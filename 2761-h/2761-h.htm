     NOTES

     It may interest readers of this story to know that its author
     believes it to have a certain foundation in fact.

     It was said about five-and-twenty or thirty years ago that an
     adventurous trader, hearing from some natives in the territory
     that lies at the back of Quilimane, the legend of a great treasure
     buried in or about the sixteenth century by a party of Portuguese
     who were afterwards massacred, as a last resource attempted its
     discovery by the help of a mesmerist. According to this history
     the child who was used as a subject in the experiment, when in a
     state of trance, detailed the adventures and death of the unhappy
     Portuguese men and women, two of whom leapt from the point of a
     high rock into the Zambesi. Although he knew no tongue but
     English, this clairvoyant child is declared to have repeated in
     Portuguese the prayers these unfortunates offered up, and even to
     have sung the very hymns they sang. Moreover, with much other
     detail, he described the burial of the great treasure and its
     exact situation so accurately that the white man and the mesmerist
     were able to dig for and find the place where <i>it had been</i>&mdash;for
     the bags were gone, swept out by the floods of the river.

     Some gold coins remained, however, one of them a ducat of Aloysius
     Mocenigo, Doge of Venice. Afterwards the boy was again thrown into
     a trance (in all he was mesmerized eight times), and revealed
     where the sacks still lay; but before the white trader could renew
     his search for them, the party was hunted out of the country by
     natives whose superstitious fears were aroused, barely escaping
     with their lives.

     It should be added that, as in the following tale, the chief who
     was ruling there when the tragedy happened, declared the place to
     be sacred, and that if it were entered evil would befall his
     tribe. Thus it came about that for generations it was never
     violated, until at length his descendants were driven farther from
     the river by war, and from one of them the white man heard the
     legend.

      CONFIDENCES
    </h3>
    <p>
      Beautiful, beautiful was that night! No air that stirred; the black smoke
      from the funnels of the mail steamer <i>Zanzibar</i> lay low over the
      surface of the sea like vast, floating ostrich plumes that vanished one by
      one in the starlight. Benita Beatrix Clifford, for that was her full name,
      who had been christened Benita after her mother and Beatrix after her
      father&rsquo;s only sister, leaning idly over the bulwark rail, thought to
      herself that a child might have sailed that sea in a boat of bark and come
      safely into port.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a tall man of about thirty years of age, who was smoking a cigar,
      strolled up to her. At his coming she moved a little as though to make
      room for him beside her, and there was something in the motion which, had
      anyone been there to observe it, might have suggested that these two were
      upon terms of friendship, or still greater intimacy. For a moment he
      hesitated, and while he did so an expression of doubt, of distress even,
      gathered on his face. It was as though he understood that a great deal
      depended on whether he accepted or declined that gentle invitation, and
      knew not which to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, much did depend upon it, no less than the destinies of both of
      them. If Robert Seymour had gone by to finish his cigar in solitude, why
      then this story would have had a very different ending; or, rather, who
      can say how it might have ended? The dread, foredoomed event with which
      that night was big would have come to its awful birth leaving certain
      words unspoken. Violent separation must have ensued, and even if both of
      them had survived the terror, what prospect was there that their lives
      would again have crossed each other in that wide Africa?
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not so fated, for just as he put his foot forward to continue
      his march Benita spoke in her low and pleasant voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to the smoking-room or to the saloon to dance, Mr. Seymour?
      One of the officers just told me that there is to be a dance,&rdquo; she added,
      in explanation, &ldquo;because it is so calm that we might fancy ourselves
      ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The smoking-room is stuffy, and my dancing days
      are over. No; I proposed to take exercise after that big dinner, and then
      to sit in a chair and fall asleep. But,&rdquo; he added, and his voice grew
      interested, &ldquo;how did you know that it was I? You never turned your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have ears in my head as well as eyes,&rdquo; she answered with a little
      laugh, &ldquo;and after we have been nearly a month together on this ship I
      ought to know your step.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never remember that anyone ever recognized it before,&rdquo; he said, more to
      himself than to her, then came and leaned over the rail at her side. His
      doubts were gone. Fate had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while there was silence between them, then he asked her if she were
      not going to the dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benita shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? You are fond of dancing, and you dance very well. Also there are
      plenty of officers for partners, especially Captain&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and he
      checked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it would be pleasant, but&mdash;Mr. Seymour, will you
      think me foolish if I tell you something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never thought you foolish yet, Miss Clifford, so I don&rsquo;t know why
      I should begin now. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going to the dance because I am afraid, yes, horribly afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid! Afraid of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know, but, Mr. Seymour, I feel as though we were all of us
      upon the edge of some dreadful catastrophe&mdash;as though there were
      about to be a mighty change, and beyond it another life, something new and
      unfamiliar. It came over me at dinner&mdash;that was why I left the table.
      Quite suddenly I looked, and all the people were different, yes, all
      except a few.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I different?&rdquo; he asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you were not,&rdquo; and he thought he heard her add &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; beneath
      her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And were you different?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I never looked at myself; I was the seer, not the seen. I
      have always been like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indigestion,&rdquo; he said reflectively. &ldquo;We eat too much on board ship, and
      the dinner was very long and heavy. I told you so, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m taking&mdash;I
      mean why I wanted to take exercise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to go to sleep afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, first the exercise, then the sleep. Miss Clifford, that is the rule
      of life&mdash;and death. With sleep thought ends, therefore for some of us
      your catastrophe is much to be desired, for it would mean long sleep and
      no thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that they were changed, not that they had ceased to think. Perhaps
      they thought the more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us pray that your catastrophe may be averted. I prescribe for
      you bismuth and carbonate of soda. Also in this weather it seems difficult
      to imagine such a thing. Look now, Miss Clifford,&rdquo; he added, with a note
      of enthusiasm in his voice, pointing towards the east, &ldquo;look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes followed his outstretched hand, and there, above the level ocean,
      rose the great orb of the African moon. Lo! of a sudden all that ocean
      turned to silver, a wide path of rippling silver stretched from it to
      them. It might have been the road of angels. The sweet soft light beat
      upon their ship, showing its tapering masts and every detail of the
      rigging. It passed on beyond them, and revealed the low, foam-fringed
      coast-line rising here and there, dotted with kloofs and their clinging
      bush. Even the round huts of Kaffir kraals became faintly visible in that
      radiance. Other things became visible also&mdash;for instance, the
      features of this pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was light in his colouring, fair-skinned, with fair hair which
      already showed a tendency towards greyness, especially in the moustache,
      for he wore no beard. His face was clean cut, not particularly handsome,
      since, their fineness notwithstanding, his features lacked regularity; the
      cheekbones were too high and the chin was too small, small faults redeemed
      to some extent by the steady and cheerful grey eyes. For the rest, he was
      broad-shouldered and well-set-up, sealed with the indescribable stamp of
      the English gentleman. Such was the appearance of Robert Seymour.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that light the girl at his side looked lovely, though, in fact, she had
      no real claims to loveliness, except perhaps as regards her figure, which
      was agile, rounded, and peculiarly graceful. Her foreign-looking face was
      unusual, dark-eyed, a somewhat large and very mobile mouth, fair and
      waving hair, a broad forehead, a sweet and at times wistful face,
      thoughtful for the most part, but apt to be irradiated by sudden smiles.
      Not a beautiful woman at all, but exceedingly attractive, one possessing
      magnetism.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed, first at the moon and the silver road beneath it, then,
      turning, at the land beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are very near to Africa, at last,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too near, I think,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;If I were the captain I should stand
      out a point or two. It is a strange country, full of surprises. Miss
      Clifford, will you think me rude if I ask you why you are going there? You
      have never told me&mdash;quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, because the story is rather a sad one; but you shall hear it if you
      wish. Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, and drew up two deck chairs, in which they settled themselves
      in a corner made by one of the inboard boats, their faces still towards
      the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I was born in Africa,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and lived there till I was
      thirteen years old&mdash;why, I find I can still speak Zulu; I did so this
      afternoon. My father was one of the early settlers in Natal. His father
      was a clergyman, a younger son of the Lincolnshire Cliffords. They are
      great people there still, though I don&rsquo;t suppose that they are aware of my
      existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know them,&rdquo; answered Robert Seymour. &ldquo;Indeed, I was shooting at their
      place last November&mdash;when the smash came,&rdquo; and he sighed; &ldquo;but go
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my father quarrelled with his father, I don&rsquo;t know what about, and
      emigrated. In Natal he married my mother, a Miss Ferreira, whose name&mdash;like
      mine and her mother&rsquo;s&mdash;was Benita. She was one of two sisters, and
      her father, Andreas Ferreira, who married an English lady, was half Dutch
      and half Portuguese. I remember him well, a fine old man with dark eyes
      and an iron-grey beard. He was wealthy as things went in those days&mdash;that
      is to say, he had lots of land in Natal and the Transvaal, and great herds
      of stock. So you see I am half English, some Dutch, and more than a
      quarter Portuguese&mdash;quite a mixture of races. My father and mother
      did not get on well together. Mr. Seymour, I may as well tell you all the
      truth: he drank, and although he was passionately fond of her, she was
      jealous of him. Also he gambled away most of her patrimony, and after old
      Andreas Ferreira&rsquo;s death they grew poor. One night there was a dreadful
      scene between them, and in his madness he struck her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she was a very proud woman, determined, too, and she turned on him
      and said&mdash;for I heard her&mdash;&lsquo;I will never forgive you; we have
      done with each other.&rsquo; Next morning, when my father was sober, he begged
      her pardon, but she made no answer, although he was starting somewhere on
      a fortnight&rsquo;s trek. When he had gone my mother ordered the Cape cart,
      packed up her clothes, took some money that she had put away, drove to
      Durban, and after making arrangements at the bank about a small private
      income of her own, sailed with me for England, leaving a letter for my
      father in which she said that she would never see him again, and if he
      tried to interfere with me she would put me under the protection of the
      English court, which would not allow me to be taken to the home of a
      drunkard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In England we went to live in London with my aunt, who had married a
      Major King, but was a widow with five children. My father often wrote to
      persuade my mother to go back to him, but she never would, which I think
      was wrong of her. So things went on for twelve years or more, till one day
      my mother suddenly died, and I came into her little fortune of between
      £200 and £300 a year, which she had tied up so that nobody can touch it.
      That was about a year ago. I wrote to tell my father of her death, and
      received a pitiful letter; indeed, I have had several of them. He implored
      me to come out to him and not to leave him to die in his loneliness, as he
      soon would do of a broken heart, if I did not. He said that he had long
      ago given up drinking, which was the cause of the ruin of his life, and
      sent a certificate signed by a magistrate and a doctor to that effect.
      Well, in the end, although all my cousins and their mother advised me
      against it, I consented, and here I am. He is to meet me at Durban, but
      how we shall get on together is more than I can say, though I long to see
      him, for after all he is my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was good of you to come, under all the circumstances. You must have a
      brave heart,&rdquo; said Robert reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my duty,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;And for the rest, I am not afraid who was
      born to Africa. Indeed, often and often have I wished to be back there
      again, out on the veld, far away from the London streets and fog. I am
      young and strong, and I want to see things, natural things&mdash;not those
      made by man, you know&mdash;the things I remember as a child. One can
      always go back to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, or at least some people can. It is a curious thing, Miss Clifford,
      but as it happens I have met your father. You always reminded me of the
      man, but I had forgotten his name. Now it comes back to me; it <i>was</i>
      Clifford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where on earth?&rdquo; she asked, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a queer place. As I told you, I have visited South Africa before,
      under different circumstances. Four years ago I was out here big-game
      shooting. Going in from the East coast my brother and I&mdash;he is dead
      now, poor fellow&mdash;got up somewhere in the Matabele country, on the
      banks of the Zambesi. As we didn&rsquo;t find much game there we were going to
      strike south, when some natives told us of a wonderful ruin that stood on
      a hill overhanging the river a few miles farther on. So, leaving the
      waggon on the hither side of the steep nek, over which it would have been
      difficult to drag it, my brother and I took our rifles and a bag of food
      and started. The place was farther off than we thought, although from the
      top of the nek we could see it clearly enough, and before we reached it
      dark had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we had observed a waggon and a tent outside the wall which we thought
      must belong to white men, and headed for them. There was a light in the
      tent, and the flap was open, the night being very hot. Inside two men were
      seated, one old, with a grey beard, and the other, a good-looking fellow&mdash;under
      forty, I should say&mdash;with a Jewish face, dark, piercing eyes, and a
      black, pointed beard. They were engaged in examining a heap of gold beads
      and bangles, which lay on the table between them. As I was about to speak,
      the black-bearded man heard or caught sight of us, and seizing a rifle
      that leaned against the table, swung round and covered me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t shoot, Jacob,&rsquo; said the old man; &lsquo;they are
      English.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Best dead, any way,&rsquo; answered the other, in a soft voice, with a slight
      foreign accent, &lsquo;we don&rsquo;t want spies or thieves here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We are neither, but I can shoot as well as you, friend,&rsquo; I remarked, for
      by this time my rifle was on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he thought better of it, and dropped his gun, and we explained that
      we were merely on an archæological expedition. The end of it was that we
      became capital friends, though neither of us could cotton much to Mr.
      Jacob&mdash;I forget his other name. He struck me as too handy with his
      rifle, and was, I gathered, an individual with a mysterious and rather
      lurid past. To cut a long story short, when he found out that we had no
      intention of poaching, your father, for it was he, told us frankly that
      they were treasure-hunting, having got hold of some story about a vast
      store of gold which had been hidden away there by Portuguese two or three
      centuries before. Their trouble was, however, that the Makalanga, who
      lived in the fortress, which was called Bambatse, would not allow them to
      dig, because they said the place was haunted, and if they did so it would
      bring bad luck to their tribe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did they ever get in?&rdquo; asked Benita.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know, for we went next day, though before we left we
      called on the Makalanga, who admitted us all readily enough so long as we
      brought no spades with us. By the way, the gold we saw your father and his
      friend examining was found in some ancient graves outside the walls, but
      had nothing to do with the big and mythical treasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the place like? I love old ruins,&rdquo; broke in Benita again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! wonderful. A gigantic, circular wall built by heaven knows who, then
      half-way up the hill another wall, and near the top a third wall which, I
      understood, surrounded a sort of holy of holies, and above everything, on
      the brink of the precipice, a great cone of granite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Artificial or natural?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. They would not let us up there, but we were introduced to
      their chief and high priest, Church and State in one, and a wonderful old
      man he was, very wise and very gentle. I remember he told me he believed
      we should meet again, which seemed an odd thing for him to say. I asked
      him about the treasure and why he would not let the other white men look
      for it. He answered that it would never be found by any man, white or
      black, that only a woman would find it at the appointed time, when it
      pleased the Spirit of Bambatse, under whose guardianship it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was the Spirit of Bambatse, Mr. Seymour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you, couldn&rsquo;t make out anything definite about her, except
      that she was said to be white, and to appear sometimes at sunrise, or in
      the moonlight, standing upon the tall point of rock of which I told you. I
      remember that I got up before the dawn to look for her&mdash;like an
      idiot, for of course I saw nothing&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all I know about the
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you have any talk with my father, Mr. Seymour&mdash;alone, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a little. The next day he walked back to our waggon with us, being
      glad, I fancy, of a change from the perpetual society of his partner
      Jacob. That wasn&rsquo;t wonderful in a man who had been brought up at Eton and
      Oxford, as I found out he had, like myself, and whatever his failings may
      have been&mdash;although we saw no sign of them, for he would not touch a
      drop of spirits&mdash;was a gentleman, which Jacob wasn&rsquo;t. Still, he&mdash;Jacob&mdash;had
      read a lot, especially on out-of-the-way subjects, and could talk every
      language under the sun&mdash;a clever and agreeable scoundrel in short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did my father say anything about himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he told me that he had been an unsuccessful man all his life, and
      had much to reproach himself with, for we got quite confidential at last.
      He added that he had a family in England&mdash;what family he didn&rsquo;t say&mdash;whom
      he was anxious to make wealthy by way of reparation for past misdeeds, and
      that was why he was treasure-hunting. However, from what you tell me, I
      fear he never found anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Seymour, he never found it and never will, but all the same I am
      glad to hear that he was thinking of us. Also I should like to explore
      that place, Bambatse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So should I, Miss Clifford, in your company, and your father&rsquo;s, but not
      in that of Jacob. If ever you should go there with him, I say:&mdash;&lsquo;Beware
      of Jacob.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I am not afraid of Jacob,&rdquo; she answered with a laugh, &ldquo;although I
      believe that my father still has something to do with him&mdash;at least
      in one of his letters he mentioned his partner, who was a German.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A German! I think that he must have meant a German Jew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this there was silence between them for a time, then he said
      suddenly, &ldquo;You have told me your story, would you like to hear mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it won&rsquo;t take you long to listen to it, for, Miss Clifford, like
      Canning&rsquo;s needy knife-grinder, I have really none to tell. You see before
      you one of the most useless persons in the world, an undistinguished
      member of what is called in England the &lsquo;leisured class,&rsquo; who can do
      absolutely nothing that is worth doing, except shoot straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Benita.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not seem impressed with that accomplishment,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;yet it
      is an honest fact that for the last fifteen years&mdash;I was thirty-two
      this month&mdash;practically my whole time has been given up to it, with a
      little fishing thrown in in the spring. As I want to make the most of
      myself, I will add that I am supposed to be among the six best shots in
      England, and that my ambition&mdash;yes, great Heavens! my ambition&mdash;was
      to become better than the other five. By that sin fell the poor man who
      speaks to you. I was supposed to have abilities, but I neglected them all
      to pursue this form of idleness. I entered no profession, I did no work,
      with the result that at thirty-two I am ruined and almost hopeless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why ruined and hopeless?&rdquo; she asked anxiously, for the way in which they
      were spoken grieved her more than the words themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruined because my old uncle, the Honourable John Seymour Seymour, whose
      heir I was, committed the indiscretion of marrying a young lady who has
      presented him with thriving twins. With the appearance of those twins my
      prospects disappeared, as did the allowance of £1,500 a year that he was
      good enough to make me on which to keep up a position as his next-of-kin.
      I had something of my own, but also I had debts, and at the present moment
      a draft in my pocket for £2,163 14s. 5d., and a little loose cash,
      represents the total of my worldly goods, just about the sum I have been
      accustomed to spend per annum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call that ruin, I call that riches,&rdquo; said Benita, relieved. &ldquo;With
      £2,000 to begin on you may make a fortune in Africa. But how about the
      hopelessness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am hopeless because I have absolutely nothing to which to look forward.
      Really, when that £2,000 is gone I do not know how to earn a sixpence. In
      this dilemma it occurred to me that the only thing I could do was to turn
      my shooting to practical account, and become a hunter of big game.
      Therefore I propose to kill elephants until an elephant kills me. At
      least,&rdquo; he added in a changed voice, &ldquo;I did so propose until half an hour
      ago.&rdquo;

    <h3>
      THE END OF THE &ldquo;ZANZIBAR.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until half an hour ago? Then why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and Benita stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I changed my very modest scheme of life? Miss Clifford, as you are
      so good as to be sufficiently interested, I will tell you. It is because a
      temptation which hitherto I have been able to resist, has during the last
      thirty minutes become too strong for me. You know everything has its
      breaking strain.&rdquo; He puffed nervously at his cigar, threw it into the sea,
      paused, then went on: &ldquo;Miss Clifford, I have dared to fall in love with
      you. No; hear me out. When I have done it will be quite time enough to
      give me the answer that I expect. Meanwhile, for the first time in my
      life, allow me the luxury of being in earnest. To me it is a new
      sensation, and therefore very priceless. May I go on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita made no answer. He rose with a certain deliberateness which
      characterized all his movements&mdash;for Robert Seymour never seemed to
      be in a hurry&mdash;and stood in front of her so that the moonlight shone
      upon her face, while his own remained in shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beyond that £2,000 of which I have spoken, and incidentally its owner, I
      have nothing whatsoever to offer to you. I am an indigent and worthless
      person. Even in my prosperous days, when I could look forward to a large
      estate, although it was often suggested to me, I never considered myself
      justified in asking any lady to share&mdash;the prospective estate. I
      think now that the real reason was that I never cared sufficiently for any
      lady, since otherwise my selfishness would probably have overcome my
      scruples, as it does to-night. Benita, for I will call you so, if for the
      first and last time, I&mdash;I&mdash;love you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen now,&rdquo; he went on, dropping his measured manner, and speaking
      hurriedly, like a man with an earnest message and little time in which to
      deliver it, &ldquo;it is an odd thing, an incomprehensible thing, but true, true&mdash;I
      fell in love with you the first time I saw your face. You remember, you
      stood there leaning over the bulwark when I came on board at Southampton,
      and as I walked up the gangway, I looked and my eyes met yours. Then I
      stopped, and that stout old lady who got off at Madeira bumped into me,
      and asked me to be good enough to make up my mind if I were going backward
      or forward. Do you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which things are an allegory,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I felt it so at the time.
      Yes, I had half a mind to answer &lsquo;Backward&rsquo; and give up my berth in this
      ship. Then I looked at you again, and something inside of me said
      &lsquo;Forward.&rsquo; So I came up the rest of the gangway and took off my hat to
      you, a salutation I had no right to make, but which, I recall, you
      acknowledged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, then continued: &ldquo;As it began, so it has gone on. It is always
      like that, is it not? The beginning is everything, the end must follow.
      And now it has come out, as I was fully determined that it should not do
      half an hour ago, when suddenly you developed eyes in the back of your
      head, and&mdash;oh! dearest, I love you. No, please be quiet; I have not
      done. I have told you what I am, and really there isn&rsquo;t much more to say
      about me, for I have no particular vices except the worst of them all,
      idleness, and not the slightest trace of any virtue that I can discover.
      But I have a certain knowledge of the world acquired in a long course of
      shooting parties, and as a man of the world I will venture to give you a
      bit of advice. It is possible that to you my life and death affair is a
      mere matter of board-ship amusement. Yet it is possible also that you
      might take another view of the matter. In that case, as a friend and a man
      of the world, I entreat you&mdash;don&rsquo;t. Have nothing to do with me. Send
      me about my business; you will never regret it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you making fun, or is all this meant, Mr. Seymour?&rdquo; asked Benita,
      still speaking beneath her breath, and looking straight before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meant? Of course it is meant. How can you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have always understood that on such occasions people wish to
      make the best of themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, but I never do what I ought, a fact for which I am grateful now
      come to think of it, since otherwise I should not be here to-night. I wish
      to make the worst of myself, the very worst, for whatever I am not, at
      least I am honest. Now having told you that I am, or was half an hour ago,
      an idler, a good-for-nothing, prospectless failure, I ask you&mdash;if you
      care to hear any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She half rose, and, glancing at him for the first time, saw his face
      contract itself and turn pale in the moonlight. It may be that the sight
      of it affected her, even to the extent of removing some adverse impression
      left by the bitter mocking of his self-blame. At any rate, Benita seemed
      to change her mind, and sat down again, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, if you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed slightly, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you. I have told you what I <i>was</i> half an hour ago; now,
      hoping that you will believe me, I will tell you what I <i>am</i>. I am a
      truly repentant man, one upon whom a new light has risen. I am not very
      old, and I think that underneath it all I have some ability. Opportunity
      may still come my way; if it does not, for your sake I will make the
      opportunity. I do not believe that you can ever find anyone who would love
      you better or care for you more tenderly. I desire to live for you in the
      future, more completely even than in the past I have lived for myself. I
      do not wish to influence you by personal appeals, but in fact I stand at
      the parting of the ways. If you will give yourself to me I feel as though
      I might still become a husband of whom you could be proud&mdash;if not, I
      write &lsquo;Finis&rsquo; upon the tombstone of the possibilities of Robert Seymour. I
      adore you. You are the one woman with whom I desire to pass my days; it is
      you who have always been lacking to my life. I ask you to be brave, to
      take the risk of marrying me, although I can see nothing but poverty ahead
      of us, for I am an adventurer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak like that,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;We are all of us adventurers
      in this world, and I more than you. We have just to consider ourselves,
      not what we have or have not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it, Miss Clifford. Then I have nothing more to say; now it is for
      you to answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the sound of the piano and the fiddle in the saloon ceased. One
      of the waltzes was over, and some of the dancers came upon deck to flirt
      or to cool themselves. One pair, engaged very obviously in the former
      occupation, stationed themselves so near to Robert and Benita that further
      conversation between them was impossible, and there proceeded to
      interchange the remarks common to such occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a good ten minutes did they stand thus, carrying on a mock quarrel as
      to a dance of which one of them was supposed to have been defrauded, until
      Robert Seymour, generally a very philosophical person, could have slain
      those innocent lovers. He felt, he knew not why, that his chances were
      slipping away from him; that sensation of something bad about to happen,
      of which Benita had spoken, spread from her to him. The suspense grew
      exasperating, terrible even, nor could it be ended. To ask her to come
      elsewhere was under the circumstances not feasible, especially as he would
      also have been obliged to request the other pair to make way for them, and
      all this time, with a sinking of the heart, he felt that probably Benita
      was beating down any tenderness which she might feel towards him; that
      when her long-delayed answer did come the chances were it would be &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The piano began to play again in the saloon, and the young people, still
      squabbling archly, at length prepared to depart. Suddenly there was a stir
      upon the bridge, and against the tender sky Robert saw a man dash forward.
      Next instant the engine-room bell rang fiercely. He knew the signal&mdash;it
      was &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; followed at once by other ringings that meant &ldquo;Full speed
      astern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what is up?&rdquo; said the young man to the young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the words had left his lips they knew. There was a sensation as
      though all the hull of the great ship had come to a complete standstill,
      while the top part of her continued to travel forward; followed by another
      sensation still more terrible and sickening in its nature&mdash;that of
      slipping over something, helplessly, heavily, as a man slips upon ice or a
      polished floor. Spars cracked, ropes flew in two with a noise as of pistol
      shots. Heavy objects rushed about the deck, travelling forwards all of
      them. Benita was hurled from her chair against Robert so that the two of
      them rolled into the scuppers. He was unhurt and picked himself up, but
      she lay still, and he saw that something had struck her upon the head, for
      blood was running down her cheek. He lifted her, and, filled with black
      horror and despair&mdash;for he thought her gone&mdash;pressed his hand
      upon her heart. Thank God! it began to beat again&mdash;she still lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music in the saloon had stopped, and for a little while there was
      silence. Then of an instant there arose the horrible clamour of shipwreck;
      wild-eyed people rushed to and fro aimlessly; here and there women and
      children shrieked; a clergyman fell upon his knees and began to pray.
    </p>
    <p>
      This went on for a space, till presently the second officer appeared and,
      affecting an unconcerned air, called out that it was all right, the
      captain said no one was to be afraid. He added that they were not more
      than six miles from the shore, and that the ship would be beached in half
      an hour. Indeed, as he spoke the engines, which had been stopped,
      commenced to work again, and her head swung round in a wide circle,
      pointing to the land. Evidently they had passed over the rock and were
      once more in deep water, through which they travelled at a good speed but
      with a heavy list to starboard. The pumps got to work also with a
      monotonous, clanging beat, throwing out great columns of foaming water on
      to the oily sea. Men began to cut the covers off the boats, and to swing
      some of them outboard. Such were the things that went on about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the senseless Benita clasped to his breast, the blood from her cut
      head running down his shoulder, Robert stood still awhile, thinking. Then
      he made up his mind. As it chanced, she had a deck cabin, and thither he
      forced his way, carrying her tenderly and with patience through the
      distracted throng of passengers, for there were five hundred souls on
      board that ship. He reached the place to find that it was quite empty, her
      cabinmate having fled. Laying Benita upon the lower bunk, he lit the
      swinging candle. As soon as it burned up he searched for the lifebelts and
      by good fortune found two of them, one of which, not without great
      difficulty, he succeeded in fastening round her. Then he took a sponge and
      bathed her head with water. There was a great bruise upon her temple where
      the block or whatever it was had struck her, and the blood still flowed;
      but the wound was not very deep or extensive, nor, so far as he could
      discover, did the bone appear to be broken or driven in. He had good hope
      that she was only stunned, and would revive presently. Unable to do more
      for her, a thought struck him. On the floor of the cabin, thrown by the
      shock from the rack, lay her writing case. He opened it, and taking a
      piece of paper wrote these words hurriedly in pencil:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gave me no answer, and it is more than probable that I shall receive
      none in this world which one or both of us may be upon the verge of
      leaving. In the latter case we can settle the matter elsewhere&mdash;perhaps.
      In the former, should it be my lot to go and yours to stay, I hope that
      you will think kindly of me at times as of one who loved you truly. Should
      it be yours to go, then you will never read these words. Yet if to the
      dead is given knowledge, be assured that as you left me so you shall find
      me, yours and yours alone. Or perhaps we both may live; I pray so.&mdash;S.
      R. S.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Folding up the paper, he undid a button of Benita&rsquo;s blouse and thrust it
      away there, knowing that thus she would certainly find it should she
      survive. Then he stepped out on to the deck to see what was happening. The
      vessel still steamed, but made slow progress; moreover, the list to
      starboard was now so pronounced that it was difficult to stand upright. On
      account of it nearly all the passengers were huddled together upon the
      port side, having instinctively taken refuge as far as possible above the
      water. A man with a white, distraught face staggered towards him,
      supporting himself by the bulwarks. It was the captain. For a moment he
      paused as though to think, holding to a stanchion. Robert Seymour saw his
      opportunity and addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I do not like interfering with other people&rsquo;s
      business, but for reasons unconnected with myself I suggest to you that it
      would be wise to stop this ship and get out the boats. The sea is calm; if
      it is not left till too late there should be no difficulty in launching
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man stared at him absently, then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t hold everybody, Mr. Seymour. I hope to beach her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least they will hold some,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;whereas&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And
      he pointed to the water, which by now was almost level with the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are right, Mr. Seymour. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to me, anyway. I am
      a ruined man; but the poor passengers&mdash;the poor passengers!&rdquo; And he
      scrambled away fiercely towards the bridge like a wounded cat along the
      bough of a tree, whence in a few seconds Robert heard him shouting orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute or so afterwards the steamer stopped. Too late the captain had
      decided to sacrifice his ship and save those she carried. They were
      beginning to get out the boats. Now Robert returned to the cabin where
      Benita was lying senseless, and wrapped her up in a cloak and some
      blankets. Then, seeing the second lifebelt on the floor, by an
      afterthought he put it on, knowing that there was time to spare. Next he
      lifted Benita, and feeling sure that the rush would be for the starboard
      side, on which the boats were quite near the water, carried her, with
      difficulty, for the slope was steep, to the port-cutter, which he knew
      would be in the charge of a good man, the second officer, whom he had seen
      in command there at Sunday boat-drills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, as he had anticipated, the crowd was small, since most people
      thought that it would not be possible to get this boat down safely to the
      water; or if their powers of reflection were gone, instinct told them so.
      That skilful seaman, the second officer, and his appointed crew, were
      already at work lowering the cutter from the davits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;women and children first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A number rushed in, and Robert saw that the boat would soon be full.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I must count myself a woman as I carry one,&rdquo;
       and by a great effort, holding Benita with one arm, with the other he let
      himself down the falls and, assisted by a quartermaster, gained the boat
      in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      One or two other men scrambled after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Push her off,&rdquo; said the officer; &ldquo;she can hold no more,&rdquo; and the ropes
      were let go.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were about twelve feet from the ship&rsquo;s side, from which they
      thrust themselves clear with oars, there came a rush of people,
      disappointed of places in the starboard boats. A few of the boldest of
      these swarmed down the falls, others jumped and fell among them, or missed
      and dropped into the sea, or struck upon the sides of the boat and were
      killed. Still she reached the water upon an even keel, though now much
      overladen. The oars were got out, and they rowed round the bow of the
      great ship wallowing in her death-throes, their first idea being to make
      for the shore, which was not three miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought them to the starboard side, where they saw a hideous scene.
      Hundreds of people seemed to be fighting for room, with the result that
      some of the boats were overturned, precipitating their occupants into the
      water. Others hung by the prow or the stern, the ropes having jammed in
      the davits in the frantic haste and confusion, while from them human
      beings dropped one by one. Round others not yet launched a hellish
      struggle was in progress, the struggle of men, women, and children
      battling for their lives, in which the strong, mad with terror, showed no
      mercy to the weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that mass of humanity, most of them about to perish, went up a babel
      of sounds which in its sum shaped itself to one prolonged scream, such as
      might proceed from a Titan in his agony. All this beneath a brooding,
      moonlit sky, and on a sea as smooth as glass. Upon the ship, which now lay
      upon her side, the siren still sent up its yells for succour, and some
      brave man continued to fire rockets, which rushed heavenwards and burst in
      showers of stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert remembered that the last rocket he had seen was fired at an evening
      <i>fête</i> for the amusement of the audience. The contrast struck him as
      dreadful. He wondered whether there were any power or infernal population
      that could be amused by a tragedy such as enacted itself before his eyes;
      how it came about also that such a tragedy was permitted by the merciful
      Strength in which mankind put their faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vessel was turning over, compressed air or steam burst up the decks
      with loud reports; fragments of wreckage flew into the air. There the poor
      captain still clung to the rail of the bridge. Seymour could see his white
      face&mdash;the moonlight seemed to paint it with a ghastly smile. The
      officer in command of their boat shouted to the crew to give way lest they
      should be sucked down with the steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look! Now she wallowed like a dying whale, the moonrays shone white upon
      her bottom, showing the jagged rent made in it by the rock on which she
      had struck, and now she was gone. Only a little cloud of smoke and steam
      remained to mark where the <i>Zanzibar</i> had been.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      HOW ROBERT CAME ASHORE
    </h3>
    <p>
      In place of the <i>Zanzibar</i> a great pit on the face of the ocean, in
      which the waters boiled and black objects appeared and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit still, for your lives&rsquo; sake,&rdquo; said the officer in a quiet voice; &ldquo;the
      suck is coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another minute it came, dragging them downward till the water trickled
      over the sides of the boat, and backward towards the pit. But before ever
      they reached it the deep had digested its prey, and, save for the great
      air-bubbles which burst about them and a mixed, unnatural swell, was calm
      again. For the moment they were safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passengers,&rdquo; said the officer, &ldquo;I am going to put out to sea&mdash;at any
      rate, till daylight. We may meet a vessel there, and if we try to row
      ashore we shall certainly be swamped in the breakers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one objected; they seemed too stunned to speak, but Robert thought to
      himself that the man was wise. They began to move, but before they had
      gone a dozen yards something dark rose beside them. It was a piece of
      wreckage, and clinging to it a woman, who clasped a bundle to her breast.
      More, she was alive, for she began to cry to them to take her in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save me and my child!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake save me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robert recognized the choking voice; it was that of a young married lady
      with whom he had been very friendly, who was going out with her baby to
      join her husband in Natal. He stretched out his hand and caught hold of
      her, whereon the officer said, heavily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boat is already overladen. I must warn you that to take more aboard
      is not safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereon the passengers awoke from their stupor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Push her off,&rdquo; cried a voice; &ldquo;she must take her chance.&rdquo; And there was a
      murmur of approval at the dreadful words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Christ&rsquo;s sake&mdash;for Christ&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; wailed the drowning woman,
      who clung desperately to Robert&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you try to pull her in, we will throw you overboard,&rdquo; said the voice
      again, and a knife was lifted as though to hack at his arm. Then the
      officer spoke once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This lady cannot come into the boat unless someone goes out of it. I
      would myself, but it is my duty to stay. Is there any man here who will
      make place for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But all the men there&mdash;seven of them, besides the crew&mdash;hung
      their heads and were silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give way,&rdquo; said the officer in the same heavy voice; &ldquo;she will drop off
      presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the words passed his lips Robert seemed to live a year. Here was an
      opportunity of atonement for his idle and luxurious life. An hour ago he
      would have taken it gladly, but now&mdash;now, with Benita senseless on
      his breast, and that answer still locked in her sleeping heart? Yet Benita
      would approve of such a death as this, and even if she loved him not in
      life, would learn to love his memory. In an instant his mind was made up,
      and he was speaking rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thompson,&rdquo; he said to the officer, &ldquo;if I go, will you swear to take her
      in and her child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Mr. Seymour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then lay to; I am going. If any of you live, tell this lady how I died,&rdquo;
       and he pointed to Benita, &ldquo;and say I thought that she would wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shall be told,&rdquo; said the officer again, &ldquo;and saved, too, if I can do
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold Mrs. Jeffreys, then, till I am out of this. I&rsquo;ll leave my coat to
      cover her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sailor obeyed, and with difficulty Robert wrenched free his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very deliberately he pressed Benita to his breast and kissed her on the
      forehead, then let her gently slide on to the bottom of the boat. Next he
      slipped off his overcoat and slowly rolled himself over the gunwale into
      the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;pull Mrs. Jeffreys in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you; you are a brave man,&rdquo; said Thompson. &ldquo;I shall remember you
      if I live a hundred years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But no one else said anything; perhaps they were all too much ashamed,
      even then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only done my duty,&rdquo; Seymour answered from the water. &ldquo;How far is
      it to the shore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About three miles,&rdquo; shouted Thompson. &ldquo;But keep on that plank, or you
      will never live through the rollers. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; answered Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the boat passed away from him and soon vanished in the misty face of
      the deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resting on the plank which had saved the life of Mrs. Jeffreys, Robert
      Seymour looked about him and listened. Now and again he heard a faint,
      choking scream uttered by some drowning wretch, and a few hundred yards
      away caught sight of a black object which he thought might be a boat. If
      so, he reflected that it must be full. Moreover, he could not overtake it.
      No; his only chance was to make for the shore. He was a strong swimmer,
      and happily the water was almost as warm as milk. There seemed to be no
      reason why he should not reach it, supported as he was by a lifebelt, if
      the sharks would leave him alone, which they might, as there was plenty
      for them to feed on. The direction he knew well enough, for now in the
      great silence of the sea he could hear the boom of the mighty rollers
      breaking on the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, those rollers! He remembered how that very afternoon Benita and he had
      watched them through his field glass sprouting up against the cruel walls
      of rock, and wondered that when the ocean was so calm they had still such
      power. Now, should he live to reach them, he was doomed to match himself
      against that power. Well, the sooner he did so the sooner it would be
      over, one way or the other. This was in his favour: the tide had turned,
      and was flowing shorewards. Indeed, he had little to do but to rest upon
      his plank, which he placed crosswise beneath his breast, and steered
      himself with his feet. Even thus he made good progress, nearly a mile an
      hour perhaps. He could have gone faster had he swum, but he was saving his
      strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange journey upon that silent sea beneath those silent stars,
      and strange thoughts came into Robert&rsquo;s soul. He wondered whether Benita
      would live and what she would say. Perhaps, however, she was already dead,
      and he would meet her presently. He wondered if he were doomed to die, and
      whether this sacrifice of his would be allowed to atone for his past
      errors. He hoped so, and put up a petition to that effect, for himself and
      for Benita, and for all the poor people who had gone before, hurled from
      their pleasure into the halls of Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he floated on while the boom of the breakers grew ever nearer,
      companioned by his wild, fretful thoughts, till at length what he took to
      be a shark appeared quite close to him, and in the urgency of the moment
      he gave up wondering. It proved to be only a piece of wood, but later on a
      real shark did come, for he saw its back fin. However, this cruel creature
      was either gorged or timid, for when he splashed upon the water and
      shouted, it went away, to return no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, at length, Robert entered upon the deep hill and valley swell which
      preceded the field of the rollers. Suddenly he shot down a smooth slope,
      and without effort of his own found himself borne up an opposing steep,
      from the crest of which he had a view of white lines of foam, and beyond
      them of a dim and rocky shore. At one spot, a little to his right, the
      foam seemed thinner and the line of cliff to be broken, as though here
      there was a cleft. For this cleft, then, he steered his plank, taking the
      swell obliquely, which by good fortune the set of the tide enabled him to
      do without any great exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valleys grew deeper, and the tops of the opposing ridges were crested
      with foam. He had entered the rollers, and the struggle for life began.
      Before him they rushed solemn and mighty. Viewed from some safe place even
      the sight of these combers is terrible, as any who have watched them from
      this coast, or from that of the Island of Ascension, can bear witness.
      What their aspect was to this shipwrecked man, supported by a single
      plank, may therefore be imagined, seen, as he saw them, in the mysterious
      moonlight and in utter loneliness. Yet his spirit rose to meet the dread
      emergency; if he were to die, he would die fighting. He had grown cold and
      tired, but now the chill and weariness left him; he felt warm and strong.
      From the crest of one of the high rollers he thought he saw that about
      half a mile away from him a little river ran down the centre of the gorge,
      and for the mouth of this river he laid his course.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first all went well. He was borne up the seas; he slid down the seas in
      a lather of white foam. Presently the rise and fall grew steeper, and the
      foam began to break over his head. Robert could no longer guide himself;
      he must go as he was carried. Then in an instant he was carried into a
      hell of waters where, had it not been for his lifebelt and the plank, he
      must have been beaten down and have perished. As it was, now he was driven
      into the depths, and now he emerged upon their surface to hear their
      seething hiss around him, and above it all a continuous boom as of great
      guns&mdash;the boom of the breaking seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plank was almost twisted from his grasp, but he clung to it
      desperately, although its edges tore his arms. When the rollers broke over
      him he held his breath, and when he was tossed skywards on their curves,
      drew it again in quick, sweet gasps. Now he sat upon the very brow of one
      of them as a merman might; now he dived like a dolphin, and now, just as
      his senses were leaving him, his feet touched bottom. Another moment and
      Robert was being rolled along that bottom with a weight on him like the
      weight of mountains. The plank was rent from him, but his cork jacket
      brought him up. The backwash drew him with it into deeper water, where he
      lay helpless and despairing, for he no longer had any strength to struggle
      against his doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was that there came a mighty roller, bigger than any that he had
      seen&mdash;such a one as on that coast the Kaffirs call &ldquo;a father of
      waves.&rdquo; It caught him in the embrace of its vast green curve. It bore him
      forward as though he were but a straw, far forward over the stretch of
      cruel rocks. It broke in thunder, dashing him again upon the stones and
      sand of the little river bar, rolling him along with its resistless might,
      till even that might was exhausted, and its foam began to return seawards,
      sucking him with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert&rsquo;s mind was almost gone, but enough of it remained to tell him that
      if once more he was dragged into the deep water he must be lost. As the
      current haled him along he gripped at the bottom with his hands, and by
      the mercy of Heaven they closed on something. It may have been a
      tree-stump embedded there, or a rock&mdash;he never knew. At least, it was
      firm, and to it he hung despairingly. Would that rush never cease? His
      lungs were bursting; he must let go! Oh! the foam was thinning; his head
      was above it now; now it had departed, leaving him like a stranded fish
      upon the shingle. For half a minute or more he lay there gasping, then
      looked behind him to see another comber approaching through the gloom. He
      struggled to his feet, fell, rose again, and ran, or rather, staggered
      forward with that tigerish water hissing at his heels. Forward, still
      forward, till he was beyond its reach&mdash;yes, on dry sand. Then his
      vital forces failed him; one of his legs gave way, and, bleeding from a
      hundred hurts, he fell heavily onto his face, and there was still.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat in which Benita lay, being so deep in the water, proved very hard
      to row against the tide, for the number of its passengers encumbered the
      oarsmen. After a while a light off land breeze sprang up, as here it often
      does towards morning; and the officer, Thompson, determined to risk
      hoisting the sail. Accordingly this was done&mdash;with some difficulty,
      for the mast had to be drawn out and shipped&mdash;although the women
      screamed as the weight of the air bent their frail craft over till the
      gunwale was almost level with the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyone who moves shall be thrown overboard!&rdquo; said the officer, who
      steered, after which they were quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they made good progress seawards, but the anxieties of those who knew
      were very great, since the wind showed signs of rising, and if any swell
      should spring up that crowded cutter could scarcely hope to live. In fact,
      two hours later they were forced to lower the sail again and drift,
      waiting for the dawn. Mr. Thompson strove to cheer them, saying that now
      they were in the track of vessels, and if they could see none when the
      light came, he would run along the shore in the hope of finding a place
      free of breakers where they might land. If they did not inspire hope, at
      least his words calmed them, and they sat in heavy silence, watching the
      sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length it grew grey, and then, with a sudden glory peculiar to South
      Africa, the great red sun arose and began to dispel the mist from the
      surface of the sea. Half an hour more and this was gone, and now the
      bright rays brought life back into their chilled frames as they stared at
      each other to see which of their company were still left alive. They even
      asked for food, and biscuit was given to them with water.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while Benita remained unconscious. Indeed, one callous fellow,
      who had been using her body as a footstool, said that she must be dead,
      and had better be thrown overboard, as it would lighten the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you throw that lady into the sea, living or dead,&rdquo; said Mr. Thompson,
      with an ominous lift of his eye, &ldquo;you go with her, Mr. Batten. Remember
      who brought her here and how he died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mr. Batten held his peace, while Thompson stood up and scanned the
      wide expanse of sea. Presently he whispered to a sailor near him, who also
      stood up, looked, and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be the other Line&rsquo;s intermediate boat,&rdquo; he said, and the
      passengers, craning their heads round, saw far away to the right a streak
      of smoke upon the horizon. Orders were given, a little corner of sail was
      hoisted, with a white cloth of some sort tied above it, and the oars were
      got out. Once more the cutter moved forward, bearing to the left in the
      hope of intercepting the steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came on with terrible swiftness, and they who had miles of water to
      cover, dared hoist no more sail in that breeze. In half an hour she was
      nearly opposite to them, and they were still far away. A little more sail
      was let out, driving them through the water at as quick a rate as they
      could venture to go. The steamer was passing three miles or so away, and
      black despair took hold of them. Now the resourceful Thompson, without
      apologies, undressed, and removing the white shirt that he had worn at the
      dance, bade a sailor to tie it to an oar and wave it to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the steamer went on, until presently they heard her siren going, and
      saw that she was putting about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has seen us,&rdquo; said Thompson. &ldquo;Thank God, all of you, for there is
      wind coming up. Pull down that sail; we shan&rsquo;t need it any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later, with many precautions, for the wind he prophesied was
      already troubling the sea and sending little splashes of water over the
      stern of their deeply laden boat, they were fast to a line thrown from the
      deck of the three thousand ton steamer <i>Castle</i>, bound for Natal.
      Then, with a rattle, down came the accommodation ladder, and strong-armed
      men, standing on its grating, dragged them one by one from the death to
      which they had been so near. The last to be lifted up, except Thompson,
      was Benita, round whom it was necessary to reeve a rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any use?&rdquo; asked the officer on the grating as he glanced at her quiet
      form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say; I hope so,&rdquo; answered Thompson. &ldquo;Call your doctor.&rdquo; And gently
      enough she was borne up the ship&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      They wanted to cast off the boat, but Thompson remonstrated, and in the
      end that also was dragged to deck. Meanwhile the news had spread, and the
      awakened passengers of the <i>Castle</i>, clad in pyjamas, dressing-gowns,
      and even blankets, were crowding round the poor castaways or helping them
      to their cabins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a teetotaller,&rdquo; said second officer Thompson when he had made a
      brief report to the captain of the <i>Castle</i>, &ldquo;but if anyone will
      stand me a whiskey and soda I shall be obliged to him.&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <h3>
      MR. CLIFFORD
    </h3>
    <p>
      Although the shock of the blow she had received upon her head was
      sufficient to make her insensible for so many hours, Benita&rsquo;s injuries
      were not of a really serious nature, for as it happened the falling block,
      or whatever it may have been, had hit her forehead slantwise, and not
      full, to which accident she owed it that, although the skin was torn and
      the scalp bruised, her skull had escaped fracture. Under proper medical
      care her senses soon came back to her, but as she was quite dazed and
      thought herself still on board the <i>Zanzibar</i>, the doctor considered
      it wise to preserve her in that illusion for a while. So after she had
      swallowed some broth he gave her a sleeping draught, the effects of which
      she did not shake off till the following morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she came to herself completely, and was astonished to feel the pain
      in her head, which had been bandaged, and to see a strange stewardess
      sitting by her with a cup of beef-tea in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I? Is it a dream?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink this and I will tell you,&rdquo; answered the stewardess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benita obeyed, for she felt hungry, then repeated her question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your steamer was shipwrecked,&rdquo; said the stewardess, &ldquo;and a great many
      poor people were drowned, but you were saved in a boat. Look, there are
      your clothes; they were never in the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who carried me into the boat?&rdquo; asked Benita in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman, they say, Miss, who had wrapped you in a blanket and put a
      lifebelt on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Benita remembered everything that happened before the darkness fell&mdash;the
      question to which she had given no answer, the young couple who stood
      flirting by her&mdash;all came back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Mr. Seymour saved?&rdquo; she whispered, her face grey with dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say, Miss,&rdquo; answered the stewardess evasively. &ldquo;But there is no
      gentleman of that name aboard this ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the doctor came in, and him, too, she plied with questions.
      But having learned the story of Robert&rsquo;s self-sacrifice from Mr. Thompson
      and the others, he would give her no answer, for he guessed how matters
      had stood between them, and feared the effects of the shock. All he could
      say was that he hoped Mr. Seymour had escaped in some other boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until the third morning that Benita was allowed to learn the
      truth, which indeed it was impossible to conceal any longer. Mr. Thompson
      came to her cabin and told her everything, while she listened silently,
      horrified, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Clifford,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think it was one of the bravest things that a
      man ever did. On the ship I always thought him rather a head-in-air kind
      of swell, but he was a splendid fellow, and I pray God that he has lived,
      as the lady and child for whom he offered himself up have done, for they
      are both well again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she repeated after him mechanically, &ldquo;splendid fellow indeed, and,&rdquo;
       she added, with a strange flash of conviction, &ldquo;I believe that he <i>is</i>
      still alive. If he were dead I should know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear you say so,&rdquo; said Mr. Thompson, who believed the exact
      contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I will tell you something. When that dreadful
      accident occurred Mr. Seymour had just asked me to marry him, and I was
      going to answer that I would&mdash;because I love him. I believe that I
      shall still give him that answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompson replied again that he hoped so, which, being as honest and
      tender-hearted as he was brave and capable, he did most earnestly; but in
      his heart he reflected that her answer would not be given this side of the
      grave. Then, as he had been deputed to do, he handed her the note which
      had been found in the bosom of her dress, and, able to bear no more of
      this painful scene, hurried from the cabin. She read it greedily twice,
      and pressed it to her lips, murmuring:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will think kindly of you, Robert Seymour, kindly as woman can of
      man, and now or afterwards you shall have your answer, if you still wish
      for it. Whenever you come or wherever I go, it shall be ready for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon, when she was more composed, Mrs. Jeffreys came to see
      Benita, bringing her baby with her. The poor woman was still pale and
      shaken, but the child had taken no hurt at all from its immersion in that
      warm water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you think of me?&rdquo; she said, falling on her knees by Benita. &ldquo;But
      oh! I did not know what I was doing. It was terror and my child,&rdquo; and she
      kissed the sleeping infant passionately. &ldquo;Also I did not understand at the
      time&mdash;I was too dazed. And&mdash;that hero&mdash;he gave his life for
      me when the others wished to beat me off with oars. Yes, his blood is upon
      my hands&mdash;he who died that I and my child might live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita looked at her and answered, very gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he did not die after all. Do not grieve, for if he did it was a
      very glorious death, and I am prouder of him than I could have been had he
      lived on like the others&mdash;who wished to beat you off with oars.
      Whatever is, is by God&rsquo;s Will, and doubtless for the best. At the least,
      you and your child will be restored to your husband, though it cost me one
      who would have been&mdash;my husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening Benita came upon the deck and spoke with the other ladies who
      were saved, learning every detail that she could gather. But to none of
      the men, except to Mr. Thompson, would she say a single word, and soon,
      seeing how the matter stood, they hid themselves away from her as they had
      already done from Mrs. Jeffreys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Castle</i> had hung about the scene of the shipwreck for thirty
      hours, and rescued one other boatload of survivors, also a stoker clinging
      to a piece of wreckage. But with the shore she had been unable to
      communicate, for the dreaded wind had risen, and the breakers were quite
      impassable to any boat. To a passing steamer bound for Port Elizabeth,
      however, she had reported the terrible disaster, which by now was known
      all over the world, together with the names of those whom she had picked
      up in the boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night of the day of Benita&rsquo;s interview with Mrs. Jeffreys, the <i>Castle</i>
      arrived off Durban and anchored, since she was too big a vessel to cross
      the bar as it was in those days. At dawn the stewardess awoke Benita from
      the uneasy sleep in which she lay, to tell her that an old gentleman had
      come off in the tug and wished to see her; for fear of exciting false
      hopes she was very careful to add that word &ldquo;old.&rdquo; With her help Benita
      dressed herself, and as the sun rose, flooding the Berea, the Point, the
      white town and fair Natal beyond with light, she went on to the deck, and
      there, leaning over the bulwark, saw a thin, grey-bearded man of whom
      after all these years the aspect was still familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious thrill went through her as she looked at him leaning there lost
      in thought. After all, he was her father, the man to whom she owed her
      presence upon this bitter earth, this place of terrors and delights, of
      devastation and hope supernal. Perhaps, too, he had been as much sinned
      against as sinning. She stepped up to him and touched him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned round with all the quickness of a young man, for about him there
      was a peculiar agility which his daughter had inherited. Like his mind,
      his body was still nimble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should have known your voice anywhere. It has
      haunted my sleep for years. My darling, thank you for coming back to me,
      and thank God for preserving you when so many were lost.&rdquo; Then he threw
      his arms about her and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrank from him a little, for by inadvertence he had pressed upon the
      wound in her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it is my head. It was injured, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw the bandage about her brow, and was very penitent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did not tell me that you had been hurt, Benita,&rdquo; he exclaimed in his
      light, refined voice, one of the stamps of that gentility of blood and
      breeding whereof all his rough years and errors had been unable to deprive
      him. &ldquo;They only told me that you were saved. It is part of my ill-fortune
      that at our first moment of greeting I should give you pain, who have
      caused you so much already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita felt that the words were an apology for the past, and her heart was
      touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You did not know or mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear, I never knew or meant it. Believe me, I was not a willing
      sinner, only a weak one. You are beautiful, Benita&mdash;far more so than
      I expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; she answered smiling, &ldquo;with this bandage round my head? Well, in
      your eyes, perhaps.&rdquo; But inwardly she thought to herself that the
      description would be more applicable to her father, who in truth,
      notwithstanding his years, was wonderfully handsome, with his quick blue
      eyes, mobile face, gentle mouth with the wistful droop at the corners so
      like her own, and grey beard. How, she wondered, could this be the man who
      had struck her mother. Then she remembered him as he had been years before
      when he was a slave to liquor, and knew that the answer was simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about your escape, love,&rdquo; he said, patting her hand with his thin
      fingers. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve suffered. I was waiting at the Royal
      Hotel here, when the cable came announcing the loss of the <i>Zanzibar</i>
      and all on board. For the first time for many a year I drank spirits to
      drown my grief&mdash;don&rsquo;t be afraid, dear&mdash;for the first time and
      the last. Then afterwards came another cable giving the names of those who
      were known to be saved, and&mdash;thank God, oh! thank God&mdash;yours
      among them,&rdquo; and he gasped at the recollection of that relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I suppose I should thank&mdash;Him&mdash;and another.
      Have you heard the story about&mdash;how Mr. Seymour saved me, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of it. While you were dressing yourself, I have been talking to the
      officer who was in command of your boat. He was a brave man, Benita, and I
      am sorry to tell you he is gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She grasped a stanchion and clung there, staring at him with a wild, white
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that, Father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford drew a copy of the <i>Natal Mercury</i> of the previous day
      from the pocket of his ulster, and while she waited in an agony he hunted
      through the long columns descriptive of the loss of the <i>Zanzibar</i>.
      Presently he came to the paragraph he sought, and read it aloud to her. It
      ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The searchers on the coast opposite the scene of the shipwreck report
      that they met a Kaffir who was travelling along the seashore, who produced
      a gold watch which he said he had taken from the body of a white man that
      he found lying on the sand at the mouth of the Umvoli River. Inside the
      watch is engraved, &lsquo;To Seymour Robert Seymour, from his uncle, on his
      twenty-first birthday.&rsquo; The name of Mr. Seymour appears as a first-class
      passenger to Durban by the <i>Zanzibar</i>. He was a member of an old
      English family in Lincolnshire. This was his second journey to South
      Africa, which he visited some years ago with his brother on a big-game
      shooting expedition. All who knew him then will join with us in deploring
      his loss. Mr. Seymour was a noted shot and an English gentleman of the
      best stamp. He was last seen by one of the survivors of the catastrophe,
      carrying Miss Clifford, the daughter of the well-known Natal pioneer of
      that name, into a boat, but as this young lady is reported to have been
      saved, and as he entered the boat with her, no explanation is yet
      forthcoming as to how he came to his sad end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear that is clear enough,&rdquo; said Mr. Clifford, as he folded up his
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, clear enough,&rdquo; she repeated in a strained voice. &ldquo;And yet&mdash;yet&mdash;oh!
      Father, he had just asked me to marry him, and I can&rsquo;t believe that he is
      dead before I had time to answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;they never told me that. It is
      dreadfully sad. God help you, my poor child! There is nothing more to say
      except that he was only one among three hundred who have gone with him. Be
      brave now, before all these people. Look&mdash;here comes the tug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The following week was very much of a blank to Benita. When they reached
      shore some old friends of her father&rsquo;s took her and him to their house, a
      quiet place upon the Berea. Here, now that the first excitement of rescue
      and grief was over, the inevitable reaction set in, bringing with it
      weakness so distressing that the doctor insisted upon her going to bed,
      where she remained for the next five days. With the healing up of the
      wound in her head her strength came back to her at last, but it was a very
      sad Benita who crept from her room one afternoon on to the verandah and
      looked out at the cruel sea, peaceful now as the sky above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father, who had nursed her tenderly during these dark days, came and
      sat by her, taking her hand in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is capital,&rdquo; he said, glancing at her anxiously. &ldquo;You are getting
      quite yourself again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never be myself again,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;My old self is dead,
      although the outside of me has recovered. Father, I suppose that it is
      wrong, but I wish that I were dead too. I wish that he had taken me with
      him when he jumped into the sea to lighten the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak like that,&rdquo; he broke in hastily. &ldquo;Of course I know that I am
      not much to you&mdash;how can I be after all that is past? But I love you,
      dear, and if I were left quite alone again&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And he broke
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not be left alone if I can help it,&rdquo; she replied, looking at
      the old man with her dark and tender eyes. &ldquo;We have only each other in the
      world now, have we? The rest have gone, never to return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw his arms about her, and, drawing her to him, kissed her
      passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only you could learn to love me!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do love you,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;who now shall never love any other man
      upon the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the beginning of a deep affection which sprang up between Mr.
      Clifford and his daughter, and continued to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any news?&rdquo; she asked a little later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None&mdash;none about him. The tide took his body away, no doubt, after
      the Kaffir had gone. I remember him well now. He was a fine young man, and
      it comes into my mind that when I said good-bye to him above those old
      ruins, I wished that I had a son like that. And to think that he went so
      near to becoming a son to me! Well, the grass must bend when the wind
      blows, as the natives say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad that you knew him,&rdquo; she answered simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they began talking about other matters. He told her that all the
      story had become known, and that people spoke of Robert Seymour as &ldquo;the
      hero&rdquo;; also that there was a great deal of curiosity about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us get away as soon as we can,&rdquo; she said nervously. &ldquo;But,
      Father, where are we going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be for you to decide, love. Listen, now; this is my position. I
      have been quite steady for years, and worked hard, with the result that I
      and my partner have a fine farm in the Transvaal, on the high land near
      Lake Chrissie, out Wakkerstroom way. We breed horses there, and have done
      very well with them. I have £1,500 saved, and the farm brings us in quite
      £600 a year beyond the expenses. But it is a lonely place, with only a few
      Boers about, although they are good fellows enough. You might not care to
      live there with no company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that I should mind,&rdquo; she answered, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, but by-and-by you would when you know what it is like. Now I
      might sell my share in the farm to my partner, who, I think, would buy it,
      or I might trust to him to send me a part of the profits, which perhaps he
      would not. Then, if you wish it, we could live in or near one of the
      towns, or even, as you have an income of your own, go home to England, if
      that is your will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it your will?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;No; all my life is here. Also, I have something to
      find before I die&mdash;for your sake, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean up among those ruins?&rdquo; she asked, looking at him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. So you know about it?&rdquo; he answered, with a flash of his blue eyes.
      &ldquo;Oh! of course, Seymour told you. Yes, I mean among the ruins&mdash;but I
      will tell you that story another time&mdash;not here, not here. What do
      you wish to do, Benita? Remember, I am in your hands; I will obey you in
      all things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to stop in a town and not to go to England,&rdquo; she replied, while he
      hung eagerly upon her words, &ldquo;for this has become my holy land. Father, I
      will go with you to your farm; there I can be quiet, you and I together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered rather uneasily; &ldquo;but, you see, Benita, we shall not be
      quite alone there. My partner, Jacob Meyer, lives with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacob Meyer? Ah! I remember,&rdquo; and she winced. &ldquo;He is a German, is he not&mdash;and
      odd?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;German Jew, I imagine, and very odd. Should have made his fortune a dozen
      times over, and yet has never done anything. Too unpractical, too
      visionary, with all his brains and scheming. Not a good man, Benita,
      although he suits me, and, for the matter of that, under our agreement I
      cannot get rid of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he become your partner?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! a good many years ago he turned up at the place with a doleful story.
      Said that he had been trading among the Zulus; he was what we call a
      &lsquo;smouse&rsquo; out here, and got into a row with them, I don&rsquo;t know how. The end
      of it was that they burned his waggon, looted his trade-goods and oxen,
      and killed his servants. They would have killed him too, only, according
      to his own account, he escaped in a very queer fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he says by mesmerising the chief and making the man lead him
      through his followers. An odd story enough, but I can quite believe it of
      Jacob. He worked for me for six months, and showed himself very clever.
      Then one night, I remember it was a few days after I had told him of the
      story of the Portuguese treasure in Matabeleland, he produced £500 in Bank
      of England notes out of the lining of his waistcoat, and offered to buy a
      half interest in the farm. Yes, £500! Although for all those months I had
      believed him to be a beggar. Well, as he was so <i>slim</i>, and better
      than no company in that lonely place, in the end I accepted. We have done
      well since, except for the expedition after the treasure which we did not
      get, although we more than paid our expenses out of the ivory we bought.
      But next time we shall succeed, I am sure,&rdquo; he added with enthusiasm,
      &ldquo;that is, if we can persuade those Makalanga to let us search on the
      mountain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you had better stick to the horsebreeding,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall judge when you hear the story. But you have been brought up in
      England; will you not be afraid to go to Lake Chrissie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid of what?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! of the loneliness, and of Jacob Meyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was born on the veld, Father, and I have always hated London. As for
      your odd friend, Mr. Meyer, I am not afraid of any man on earth. I have
      done with men. At the least I will try the place and see how I get on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered her father with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;You can always
      come back, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said indifferently. &ldquo;I suppose that I can always come back.&rdquo;

    <h3>
      JACOB MEYER
    </h3>
    <p>
      More than three weeks had gone by when one morning Benita, who slept upon
      the cartel or hide-strung bed in the waggon, having dressed herself as
      best she could in that confined place, thrust aside the curtain and seated
      herself upon the voorkisse, or driving-box. The sun was not yet up, and
      the air was cold with frost, for they were on the Transvaal high-veld at
      the end of winter. Even through her thick cloak Benita shivered and called
      to the driver of the waggon, who also acted as cook, and whose
      blanket-draped form she could see bending over a fire into which he was
      blowing life, to make haste with the coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By and by, Missie&mdash;by and by,&rdquo; he answered, coughing the rank smoke
      from his lungs. &ldquo;Kettle no sing yet, and fire black as hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita reflected that popular report painted this locality red, but
      without entering into argument sat still upon the chest waiting till the
      water boiled and her father appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he emerged from under the side flap of the waggon where he
      slept, and remarking that it was really too cold to think of washing,
      climbed to her side by help of the disselboom, and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far are we now from Rooi Krantz, Father?&rdquo; she asked, for that was the
      name of Mr. Clifford&rsquo;s farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About forty miles, dear. The waggon cannot make it to-night with these
      two sick oxen, but after the midday outspan we will ride on, and be there
      by sundown. I am afraid you are tired of this trekking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I like it very much; it is so restful, and I sleep
      sound upon that cartel. I feel as though I should like to trek on for the
      rest of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you shall if you wish, dear, for whole months. South Africa is big,
      and when the grass grows, if you still wish it, we will take a long
      journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, but made no answer, knowing that he was thinking of the place
      so far away where he believed that once the Portuguese had buried gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kettle was singing now merrily enough, and Hans, the cook, lifting it
      from the fire in triumph&mdash;for his blowing exertions had been severe&mdash;poured
      into it a quantity of ground coffee from an old mustard tin. Then, having
      stirred the mixture with a stick, he took a red ember from the fire and
      dropped it into the kettle, a process which, as travellers in the veld
      know well, has a clearing effect upon the coffee. Next he produced
      pannikins, and handed them up with a pickle jar full of sugar to Mr.
      Clifford, upon the waggon chest. Milk they had none, yet that coffee
      tasted a great deal better than it looked; indeed, Benita drank two cups
      of it to warm herself and wash down the hard biscuit. Before the day was
      over glad enough was she that she had done so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was rising; huge and red it looked seen through the clinging mist,
      and, their breakfast finished, Mr. Clifford gave orders that the oxen,
      which were filling themselves with the dry grass near at hand, should be
      got up and inspanned. The voorlooper, a Zulu boy, who had left them for a
      little while to share the rest of the coffee with Hans, rose from his
      haunches with a grunt, and departed to fetch them. A minute or two later
      Hans ceased from his occupation of packing up the things, and said in a
      low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Kek!</i> Baas&rdquo;&mdash;that is &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Following the line of his outstretched hand, Benita and her father
      perceived, not more than a hundred yards away from them, a great troop of
      wilderbeeste, or gnu, travelling along a ridge, and pausing now and again
      to indulge in those extraordinary gambols which cause the Boers to declare
      that these brutes have a worm in their brains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me my rifle, Hans,&rdquo; said Mr. Clifford. &ldquo;We want meat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time that the Westley-Richards was drawn from its case and loaded,
      only one buck remained, for, having caught sight of the waggon, it turned
      to stare at it suspiciously. Mr. Clifford aimed and fired. Down went the
      buck, then springing to its feet again, vanished behind the ridge. Mr.
      Clifford shook his head sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t often do that sort of thing, my dear, but the light is still very
      bad. Still, he&rsquo;s hit. What do you say? Shall we get on the horses and
      catch him? A canter would warm you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita, who was tender-hearted, reflected that it would be kinder to put
      the poor creature out of its pain, and nodded her head. Five minutes later
      they were cantering together up the rise, Mr. Clifford having first
      ordered the waggon to trek on till they rejoined it, and slipped a packet
      of cartridges into his pocket. Beyond the rise lay a wide stretch of
      marshy ground, bordered by another rise half a mile or more away, from the
      crest of which&mdash;for now the air was clear enough&mdash;they saw the
      wounded bull standing. On they went after him, but before they could come
      within shot, he had moved forward once more, for he was only lightly hurt
      in the flank, and guessed whence his trouble came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and again did he retreat as they drew near, until at length, just as
      Mr. Clifford was about to dismount to risk a long shot, the beast took to
      its heels in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s be beat,&rdquo; for by this time the hunter was
      alive in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So off they went at a gallop, up slopes and down slopes that reminded
      Benita of the Bay of Biscay in a storm, across half-dried vleis that in
      the wet season were ponds, through stony ground and patches of ant-bear
      holes in which they nearly came to grief. For five miles at least the
      chase went on, since at the end of winter the wilderbeeste was thin and
      could gallop well, notwithstanding its injury, faster even than their good
      horses. At last, rising a ridge, they found whither it was going, for
      suddenly they were in the midst of vast herds of game, thousands and tens
      of thousands of them stretching as far as the eye could reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wondrous sight that now, alas! will be seen no more&mdash;at any
      rate upon the Transvaal veld; wilderbeeste, blesbok, springbok, in
      countless multitudes, and amongst them a few quagga and hartebeeste. With
      a sound like that of thunder, their flashing myriad hoofs casting up
      clouds of dust from the fire-blackened veld, the great herds separated at
      the appearance of their enemy, man. This way and that they went in groups
      and long brown lines, leaving the wounded and exhausted wilderbeeste
      behind them, so that presently he was the sole tenant of that great cup of
      land.
    </p>
    <p>
      At him they rode till Mr. Clifford, who was a little ahead of his
      daughter, drew almost alongside. Then the poor maddened brute tried its
      last shift. Stopping suddenly, it wheeled round and charged head down. Mr.
      Clifford, as it came, held out his rifle in his right hand and fired at a
      hazard. The bullet passed through the bull, but could not stop its charge.
      Its horns, held low, struck the forelegs of the horse, and next instant
      horse, man, and wilderbeeste rolled on the veld together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benita, who was fifty yards behind, uttered a little cry of fear, but
      before ever she reached him, her father had risen laughing, for he was
      quite unhurt. The horse, too, was getting up, but the bull could rise no
      more. It struggled to its forefeet, uttered a kind of sobbing groan,
      stared round wildly, and rolled over, dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew a wilderbeeste charge like that before,&rdquo; said Mr. Clifford.
      &ldquo;Confound it! I believe my horse is lamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lamed it was, indeed, where the bull had struck the foreleg, though, as it
      chanced, not badly. Having tied a handkerchief to the horn of the buck in
      order to scare away the vultures, and thrown some tufts of dry grass upon
      its body, which he proposed, if possible, to fetch or send for, Mr.
      Clifford mounted his lame horse and headed for the waggon. But they had
      galloped farther than they thought, and it was midday before they came to
      what they took to be the road. As there was no spoor upon it, they
      followed this track backwards, expecting to find the waggon outspanned,
      but although they rode for mile upon mile, no waggon could they see. Then,
      realizing their mistake, they retraced their steps, and leaving this path
      at the spot where they had found it, struck off again to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the sky was darkening, and at about three o&rsquo;clock in the
      afternoon a thunderstorm broke over them accompanied by torrents of icy
      rain, the first fall of the spring, and a bitter wind which chilled them
      through. More, after the heavy rain came drizzle and a thick mist that
      deepened as evening approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now their plight was very wretched. Lost, starved, soaked to the skin,
      with tired horses one of which was lame, they wandered about on the lonely
      veld. Only one stroke of fortune came to them. As the sun set, for a few
      moments its rays pierced the mist, telling them in what direction they
      should go. Turning their horses, they headed for it, and so rode on until
      the darkness fell. Then they halted a while, but feeling that if they
      stood still in that horrible cold they would certainly perish before
      morning, once more pushed on again. By now Mr. Clifford&rsquo;s horse was almost
      too lame to ride, so he led it, walking at his daughter&rsquo;s side, and
      reproaching himself bitterly for his foolishness in having brought her
      into this trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, Father,&rdquo; she answered wearily, for she was very tired.
      &ldquo;Nothing matters; one may as well die upon the veld as in the sea or
      anywhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On they plodded, they knew not whither. Benita fell asleep upon her
      saddle, and was awakened once by a hyena howling quite close to them, and
      once by her horse falling to its knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the time?&rdquo; she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father struck a match and looked at his watch. It was ten o&rsquo;clock;
      they had been fifteen hours away from the waggon and without food. At
      intervals Mr. Clifford, who had remounted, fired his rifle. Now there was
      but one cartridge left, and having caught sight of his daughter&rsquo;s
      exhausted face by the light of the match, he fired this also, though in
      that desperate wilderness there was little hope of its bringing succour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we stop or go on?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not care,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Only if I stop I think it will be for
      ever. Let us go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the rain had ceased, but the mist was as dense as before. Also they
      seemed to have got among bush, for wet leaves brushed their faces. Utterly
      exhausted they stumbled forward, till suddenly Benita felt her horse stop
      as though a hand had seized its bridle, and heard a man&rsquo;s voice, speaking
      with a foreign accent, say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mein Gott! Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I knew,&rdquo; she answered, like one in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant the moon rose above the mists, and Benita saw Jacob Meyer
      for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that light his appearance was not unpleasing. A man of about forty
      years of age, not over tall, slight and active in build, with a pointed
      black beard, regular, Semitic features, a complexion of an ivory pallor
      which even the African sun did not seem to tan, and dark, lustrous eyes
      that appeared, now to sleep, and now to catch the fire of the thoughts
      within. Yet, weary though she was, there was something in the man&rsquo;s
      personality which repelled and alarmed Benita, something wild and cruel.
      She felt that he was filled with unsatisfied ambitions and desires, and
      that to attain to them he would shrink at nothing. In a moment he was
      speaking again in tones that compelled her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a good thought that brought me here to look for you. No; not a
      thought&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;an instinct. I think your mind
      must have spoken to my mind, and called me to save you. See now, Clifford,
      my friend, where you have led your daughter. See, see!&rdquo; And he pointed
      downwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      They leaned forward and stared. There, immediately beneath them, was a
      mighty gulf whereof the moonlight did not reveal the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are no good veld traveller, Clifford, my friend; one more step of
      those silly beasts, and down below there would have been two red heaps
      with bits of bones sticking out of them&mdash;yes, there on the rocks five
      hundred feet beneath. Ah! you would have slept soundly to-night, both of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the place?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clifford in a dazed fashion. &ldquo;Leopard&rsquo;s
      Kloof?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Leopard&rsquo;s Kloof, no other. You have travelled along the top of the
      hill, not at the bottom. Certainly that was a good thought which came to
      me from the lady your daughter, for she is one of the thought senders, I
      am sure. Ah! it came to me suddenly; it hit me like a stick whilst I was
      searching for you, having found that you had lost the waggon. It said to
      me, &lsquo;Ride to the top of Leopard&rsquo;s Kloof. Ride hard.&rsquo; I rode hard through
      the rocks and the darkness, through the mist and the rain, and not one
      minute had I been here when you came and I caught the lady&rsquo;s bridle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure we are very grateful to you,&rdquo; murmured Benita.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am paid back ten thousand times. No; it is I who am grateful&mdash;I
      who have saved your life through the thought you sent me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought or no thought, all&rsquo;s well that ends well,&rdquo; broke in Mr. Clifford
      impatiently. &ldquo;And thank Heaven we are not more than three miles away from
      home. Will you lead the way, Jacob? You always could see in the dark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; and he took hold of Benita&rsquo;s bridle with his firm, white hand.
      &ldquo;Oh! my horse will follow, or put your arm through his rein&mdash;so. Now
      come on, Miss Clifford, and be afraid no more. With Jacob Meyer you are
      safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they began their descent of the hill. Meyer did not speak again; all
      his attention seemed to be concentrated upon finding a safe path on which
      the horses would not stumble. Nor did Benita speak; she was too utterly
      exhausted&mdash;so exhausted, indeed, that she could no longer control her
      mind and imagination. These seemed to loose themselves from her and to
      acquire new powers, notably that of entering into the secret thoughts of
      the man at her side. She saw them pass before her like living things, and
      yet she could not read them. Still, something she did understand&mdash;that
      she had suddenly grown important to this man, not in the way in which
      women are generally important to men, but otherwise. She felt as though
      she had become interwoven with the objects of his life, and was henceforth
      necessary to their fulfilment, as though she were someone whom he had been
      seeking for years on years, the one person who could give him light in his
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      These imaginings troubled her, so that she was very thankful when they
      passed away as swiftly as they had arisen, and she knew only that she was
      half dead with weariness and cold; that her limbs ached and that the steep
      path seemed endless.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they reached level ground, and after travelling along it for a
      while and crossing the bed of a stream, passed through a gate, and stopped
      suddenly at the door of a house with lighted windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is your home at last, Miss Clifford,&rdquo; said the musical voice of
      Jacob Meyer, &ldquo;and I thank the Fate which rules us that it has taught me to
      bring you to it safely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Making no answer she slid from the saddle, only to find that she could not
      stand, for she sank into a heap upon the ground. With a gentle exclamation
      he lifted her, and calling to two Kaffirs who had appeared to take the
      horses, led her into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must go to bed at once,&rdquo; he said, conducting her to a door which
      opened out of the sitting-room. &ldquo;I have had a fire lit in your chamber in
      case you should come, and old Tante Sally will bring you soup with brandy
      in it, and hot water for your feet. Ah! there you are, old vrouw. Come
      now; help the lady, your mistress. Is all ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All, Baas,&rdquo; answered the woman, a stout half-breed with a kindly face.
      &ldquo;Come now, my little one, and I will undress you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later Benita, having drunk more brandy than ever she had done
      in her life before, was wrapped up and fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she awoke the sun was streaming through the curtained window of her
      room, and by the light of it she saw that the clock which stood upon the
      mantelpiece pointed to half-past eleven. She had slept for nearly twelve
      hours, and felt that, notwithstanding the cold and exposure, save for
      stiffness and a certain numb feeling in her head&mdash;the result,
      perhaps, of the unaccustomed brandy&mdash;she was well and, what was more,
      quite hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside on the verandah she heard the voice of Jacob Meyer, with which she
      seemed already to have become familiar, telling some natives to stop
      singing, as they would wake the chieftainess inside. He used the Zulu word
      Inkosi-kaas, which, she remembered, meant head-lady or chieftainess. He
      was very thoughtful for her, she reflected, and was grateful, till
      suddenly she remembered the dislike she had taken to the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she looked round her room and saw that it was very pretty, well
      furnished and papered, with water-colour pictures on the walls of no mean
      merit, things that she had not expected in this far-off place. Also on a
      table stood a great bowl of arum lilies. She wondered who had put them
      there; whether it were the old half-breed, Sally, or Jacob Meyer. Also she
      wondered who had painted the pictures, which were all of African scenery,
      and something told her that both the flowers and the pictures came from
      Jacob Meyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the little table by her bed was a handbell, which presently she rang.
      Instantly she heard the voice of Sally calling for the coffee &ldquo;quick,&rdquo; and
      next minute the woman entered, bringing a tray with it, and bread and
      butter&mdash;yes, and toast and eggs, which had evidently been made ready
      for her. Speaking in English mixed with Dutch words, she told Benita that
      her father was still in bed, but sent her his love, and wished to know how
      she did. Then, while she ate her breakfast with appetite, Sally set her a
      bath, and subsequently appeared carrying the contents of the box she had
      used upon the waggon, which had now arrived safely at the farm. Benita
      asked who had ordered the box to be unpacked, and Sally answered that the
      Heer Meyer had ordered it so that she might not be disturbed in her sleep,
      and that her things should be ready for her when she woke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Heer Meyer thinks a great deal about other people,&rdquo; said Benita.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ja, ja!&rdquo; answered the old half-breed. &ldquo;He tink much about people when he
      want to tink about them, but he tink most about himself. Baas Meyer, he a
      very clever man&mdash;oh! a very clever man, who want to be a great man
      too. And one day, Missee, he be a great man, great and rich&mdash;if the
      Heer God Almighty let him.&rdquo;

      VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE GOLD COIN
    </h3>
    <p>
      Six weeks had gone by since the eventful evening of Benita&rsquo;s arrival at
      Rooi Krantz. Now the spring had fully come, the veld was emerald with
      grass and bright with flowers. In the kloof behind the house trees had put
      out their leaves, and the mimosas were in bloom, making the air heavy with
      their scent. Amongst them the ringdoves nested in hundreds, and on the
      steep rocks of the precipice the red-necked vultures fed their young.
      Along the banks of the stream and round the borders of the lake the
      pig-lilies bloomed, a sheet of white. All the place was beautiful and full
      of life and hope. Nothing seemed dead and hopeless except Benita&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her health had quite come back to her; indeed, never before had she felt
      so strong and well. But the very soul had withered in her breast. All day
      she thought, and all night she dreamed of the man who, in cold blood, had
      offered up his life to save a helpless woman and her child. She wondered
      whether he would have done this if he had heard the answer that was upon
      her lips. Perhaps that was why she had not been given time to speak that
      answer, which might have made a coward of him. For nothing more had been
      heard of Robert Seymour; indeed, already the tragedy of the ship <i>Zanzibar</i>
      was forgotten. The dead had buried their dead, and since then worse
      disasters had happened in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Benita could not bury her dead. She rode about the veld, she sat by
      the lake and watched the wild fowl, or at night heard them flighting over
      her in flocks. She listened to the cooing of the doves, the booming of the
      bitterns in the reeds, and the drumming of the snipe high in air. She
      counted the game trekking along the ridge till her mind grew weary. She
      sought consolation from the breast of Nature and found none; she sought it
      in the starlit skies, and oh! they were very far away. Death reigned
      within her who outwardly was so fair to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the society of her father, indeed, she took pleasure, for he loved her,
      and love comforted her wounded heart. In that of Jacob Meyer also she
      found interest, for now her first fear of the man had died away, and
      undoubtedly he was very interesting; well-bred also after a fashion,
      although a Jew who had lost his own faith and rejected that of the
      Christians.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her that he was a German by birth, that he had been sent to
      England as a boy, to avoid the conscription, which Jews dislike, since in
      soldiering there is little profit. Here he had become a clerk in a house
      of South African merchants, and, as a consequence&mdash;having shown all
      the ability of his race&mdash;was despatched to take charge of a branch
      business in Cape Colony. What happened to him there Benita never
      discovered, but probably he had shown too much ability of an oblique
      nature. At any rate, his connection with the firm terminated, and for
      years he became a wandering &ldquo;smouse,&rdquo; or trader, until at length he
      drifted into partnership with her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever might have been his past, however, soon she found that he was an
      extremely able and agreeable man. It was he and no other who had painted
      the water-colours that adorned her room, and he could play and sing as
      well as he painted. Also, as Robert had told her, Mr. Meyer was very
      well-read in subjects that are not usually studied on the veld of South
      Africa; indeed, he had quite a library of books, most of them histories or
      philosophical and scientific works, of which he would lend her volumes.
      Fiction, however, he never read, for the reason, he told her, that he
      found life itself and the mysteries and problems which surround it so much
      more interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, when they were walking together by the lake, watching the
      long lights of sunset break and quiver upon its surface, Benita&rsquo;s
      curiosity overcame her, and she asked him boldly how it happened that such
      a man as he was content to live the life he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order that I may reach a better,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Oh! no, not in the
      skies, Miss Clifford, for of them I know nothing, nor, as I believe, is
      there anything to know. But here&mdash;here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by a better life, Mr. Meyer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; he answered, with a flash of his dark eyes, &ldquo;great wealth, and
      the power that wealth brings. Ah! I see you think me very sordid and
      materialistic, but money is God in this world, Miss Clifford&mdash;money
      is God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and answered: &ldquo;I fear, then, that he is likely to prove an
      invisible god on the high veld, Mr. Meyer. You will scarcely make a great
      fortune out of horse-breeding, and here there is no one to rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose, then, that is why I stop at Rooi Krantz, just to breed
      horses? Has not your father told you about the great treasure hidden away
      up there among the Makalanga?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard something of it,&rdquo; she answered with a sigh. &ldquo;Also that both
      of you went to look for it and were disappointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! The Englishman who was drowned&mdash;Mr. Seymour&mdash;he spoke of
      it, did he not? He found us there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and you wished to shoot him&mdash;do you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God in Heaven! Yes, because I thought he had come to rob us. Well, I did
      not shoot, and afterwards we were hunted out of the place, which does not
      much matter, as those fools of natives refused to let us dig in the
      fortress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you still think about this treasure which probably does not
      exist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Miss Clifford, do you think about various things that probably do
      not exist? Perhaps because you feel that here or elsewhere they <i>do</i>
      exist. Well, that is what I feel about the treasure, and what I have
      always felt. It exists, and I shall find it&mdash;now. I shall live to see
      more gold than you can even imagine, and that is why I still continue to
      breed horses on the Transvaal veld. Ah! you laugh; you think it is a
      nightmare that I breed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly he became aware of Sally, who had appeared over the fold of
      the rise behind them, and asked irritably:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it now, old vrouw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Baas Clifford wants to speak with you, Baas Jacob. Messengers have
      come to you from far away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What messengers?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; answered Sally, fanning her fat face with a yellow
      pocket-handkerchief. &ldquo;They are strange people to me, and thin with
      travelling, but they talk a kind of Zulu. The Baas wishes you to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come also, Miss Clifford? No? Then forgive me if I leave you,&rdquo;
       and lifting his hat he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A strange man, Missee,&rdquo; said old Sally, when he had vanished, walking
      very fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Benita, in an indifferent voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very strange man,&rdquo; went on the old woman. &ldquo;Too much in his kop,&rdquo; and
      she tapped her forehead. &ldquo;I tink it will burst one day; but if it does not
      burst, then he will be great. I tell you that before, now I tell it you
      again, for I tink his time come. Now I go cook dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita sat by the lake till the twilight fell, and the wild geese began to
      flight over her. Then she walked back to the house thinking no more of
      Heer Meyer, thinking only that she was weary of this place in which there
      was nothing to occupy her mind and distract it from its ever present
      sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner, or rather supper, that night she noticed that both her father
      and his partner seemed to be suffering from suppressed excitement, of
      which she thought she could guess the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you find your messengers, Mr. Meyer?&rdquo; she asked, when the men had lit
      their pipes, and the square-face&mdash;as Hollands was called in those
      days, from the shape of the bottle&mdash;was set upon the rough table of
      speckled buchenhout wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I found them,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;they are in the kitchen now.&rdquo; And he
      looked at Mr. Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benita, my dear,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;rather a curious thing has happened.&rdquo;
       Her face lit up, but he shook his head. &ldquo;No, nothing to do with the
      shipwreck&mdash;that is all finished. Still, something that may interest
      you, if you care to hear a story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita nodded; she was in a mood to hear anything that would occupy her
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know something about this treasure business,&rdquo; went on her father.
      &ldquo;Well, this is the tale of it. Years ago, after you and your mother had
      gone to England, I went on a big game shooting expedition into the
      interior. My companion was an old fellow called Tom Jackson, a rolling
      stone, and one of the best elephant hunters in Africa. We did pretty well,
      but the end of it was that we separated north of the Transvaal, I bringing
      down the ivory that we had shot, and traded, and Tom stopping to put in
      another season, the arrangement being that he was to join me afterwards,
      and take his share of the money. I came here and bought this farm from a
      Boer who was tired of it&mdash;cheap enough, too, for I only gave him £100
      for the 6,000 acres. The kitchens behind were his old house, for I built a
      new one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A year had gone by before I saw any more of Tom Jackson, and then he
      turned up more dead than alive. He had been injured by an elephant, and
      lay for some months among the Makalanga to the north of Matabeleland,
      where he got fever badly at a place called Bambatse, on the Zambesi. These
      Makalanga are a strange folk. I believe their name means the People of the
      Sun; at any rate, they are the last of some ancient race. Well, while he
      was there he cured the old Molimo, or hereditary high-priest of this
      tribe, of a bad fever by giving him quinine, and naturally they grew
      friendly. The Molimo lived among ruins of which there are many over all
      that part of South Africa. No one knows who built them now; probably it
      was people who lived thousands of years ago. However, this Molimo told Tom
      Jackson a more recent legend connected with the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said that six generations before, when his great-great-great
      grandfather was chief (Mambo, he called it), the natives of all that part
      of South Africa rose against the white men&mdash;Portuguese, I suppose&mdash;who
      still worked the gold there. They massacred them and their slaves by
      thousands, driving them up from the southward, where Lobengula rules now,
      to the Zambesi by which the Portuguese hoped to escape to the coast. At
      length a remnant of them, not more than about two hundred men and women,
      arrived at the stronghold called Bambatse, where the Molimo now lives in a
      great ruin built by the ancients upon an impregnable mountain which
      overhangs the river. With them they brought an enormous quantity of gold,
      all the stored-up treasure of the land which they were trying to carry
      off. But although they reached the river they could not escape by it,
      since the natives, who pursued them in thousands, watched day and night in
      canoes, and the poor fugitives had no boats. Therefore it came about that
      they were shut up in this fortress which it was impossible to storm, and
      there slowly perished of starvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When it was known that they were all dead, the natives who had followed
      them from the south, and who wanted blood and revenge, not gold, which was
      of no use to them, went away; but the old priest&rsquo;s forefather who knew the
      secret entrance to the place, and who had been friendly to the Portuguese,
      forced his way in and there, amidst the dead, found one woman living, but
      mad with grief&mdash;a young and beautiful girl, the daughter of the
      Portuguese lord or captain. He gave her food, but in the night, when some
      strength had returned to her, she left him, and at daybreak he found her
      standing on the peak that overhangs the river, dressed all in white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He called some of his councillors, and they tried to persuade her to come
      down from the rock, but she answered, &lsquo;No, her betrothed and all her
      family and friends were dead, and it was her will to follow them.&rsquo; Then
      they asked where was the gold, for having watched day and night they knew
      it had not been thrown into the river. She answered that it was where it
      was, and that, seek as he might, no black man would ever find it. She
      added that she gave it into his keeping, and that of his descendants, to
      safeguard until she came again. Also she said that if they were faithless
      to that trust, then it had been revealed to her from heaven above that
      those same savages who had killed her father and her people, would kill
      his people also. When she had spoken thus she stood a while praying on the
      peak, then suddenly hurled herself into the river, and was seen no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From that day to this the ruin has been held to be haunted, and save the
      Molimo himself, who retires there to meditate and receive revelations from
      the spirits, no one is allowed to set a foot in its upper part; indeed,
      the natives would rather die than do so. Consequently the gold still
      remains where it was hidden. This place itself Tom Jackson did not see,
      since, notwithstanding his friendship for him, the Molimo refused to allow
      him to enter there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Tom never recovered; he died here, and is buried in the little
      graveyard behind the house which the Boers made for some of their people.
      It was shortly before his death that Mr. Meyer became my partner, for I
      forgot to say that I had told him the story, and we determined to have a
      try for that great wealth. You know the rest. We trekked to Bambatse,
      pretending to be traders, and found the old Molimo who knew of me as
      having been Tom Jackson&rsquo;s friend. We asked him if the story he had told to
      Jackson were true, and he answered that, surely as the sun shone in the
      heavens, it was true&mdash;every word of it&mdash;for it, and much more
      than he had spoken of, had been handed down from father to son, and that
      they even knew the name of the white lady who had killed herself. It was
      Ferreira&mdash;your mother&rsquo;s name, Benita, though a common one enough in
      South Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We asked him to allow us to enter the topmost stronghold, which stands
      upon the hill, but he refused, saying that the curse still lay upon him
      and his, and that no man should enter until the lady Ferreira came again.
      For the rest the place was free to us; we might dig as we would. So we did
      dig, and found some gold buried with the ancients, beads and bangles and
      wire&mdash;about £100 worth. Also&mdash;that was on the day when the young
      Seymours came upon us, and accounts for Meyer&rsquo;s excitement, for he thought
      that we were on the track of the treasure&mdash;we found a single gold
      coin, no doubt one that had been dropped by the Portuguese. Here it is.&rdquo;
       And he threw a thin piece of gold on the table before her. &ldquo;I have shown
      it to a man learned in those matters, and he says that it is a ducat
      struck by one of the doges of Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we never found any more. The end of it was that the Makalanga
      caught us trying to get in to the secret stronghold by stealth, and gave
      us the choice of clearing out or being killed. So we cleared out, for
      treasure is not of much use to dead men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford ceased speaking, and filled his pipe, while Meyer helped
      himself to squareface in an absent manner. As for Benita, she stared at
      the quaint old coin, which had a hole in it, wondering with what scenes of
      terror and of bloodshed it had been connected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep it,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;It will go on that bracelet of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, dear,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Though I don&rsquo;t know why I should take
      all the Portuguese treasure since we shall never see any more of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, Miss Clifford?&rdquo; asked Meyer quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The story tells you why&mdash;because the natives won&rsquo;t even let you look
      for it; also, looking and finding are different things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Natives change their minds sometimes, Miss Clifford. That story is not
      done, it is only begun, and now you shall hear its second chapter.
      Clifford, may I call in the messengers?&rdquo; And without waiting for an answer
      he rose and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Mr. Clifford nor his daughter said anything after he had gone.
      Benita appeared to occupy herself in fixing the broad gold coin to a
      little swivel on her bracelet, but while she did so once more that sixth
      sense of hers awoke within her. As she had been afraid at the dinner on
      the doomed steamer, so again she was afraid. Again death and great fear
      cast their advancing shadows on to her soul. That piece of gold seemed to
      speak to her, yet, alas! she could not understand its story. Only she knew
      that her father and Jacob Meyer and&mdash;yes, yes, yes&mdash;Robert
      Seymour, had all a part in that tragedy. Oh! how could that be when he was
      dead? How could this gold link him to her? She knew not&mdash;she cared
      not. All she knew was that she would follow this treasure to the edge of
      the world, and if need be, over it, if only it brought her back to him
      again.

    <h3>
      THE MESSENGERS
    </h3>
    <p>
      The door opened, and through it came Jacob Meyer, followed by three
      natives. Benita did not see or hear them; her soul was far away. There at
      the head of the room, clad all in white, for she wore no mourning save in
      her heart, illuminated by the rays of the lamp that hung above her, she
      stood still and upright, for she had risen; on the face and in her wide,
      dark eyes a look that was very strange to see. Jacob Meyer perceived it
      and stopped; the three natives perceived it also and stopped. There they
      stood, all four of them, at the end of the long sitting-room, staring at
      the white Benita and at her haunted eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the natives pointed with his thin finger to her face, and whispered
      to the others. Meyer, who understood their tongue, caught the whisper. It
      was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold the Spirit of the Rock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What spirit, and what rock?&rdquo; he asked in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She who haunts Bambatse; she whom our eyes have seen,&rdquo; answered the man,
      still staring at Benita.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benita heard the whispering, and knew it was about herself, though not one
      word of it did she catch. With a sigh she shook herself free from her
      visions and sat down in a chair close by. Then one by one the messengers
      drew near to her, and each, as he came, made a profound obeisance,
      touching the floor with his finger-tips, and staring at her face. But her
      father they only saluted with an uplifted hand. She looked at them with
      interest, and indeed they were interesting in their way; tall, spare men,
      light coloured, with refined, mobile faces. Here was no negro-blood, but
      rather that of some ancient people such as Egyptians or Phoenicians: men
      whose forefathers had been wise and civilized thousands of years ago, and
      perchance had stood in the courts of Pharaoh or of Solomon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their salutations finished, the three men squatted in a line upon the
      floor, drawing their fur karosses, or robes, about them, and waited in
      silence. Jacob Meyer thought a while, then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clifford, will you translate to your daughter, so that she may be sure
      she is told exactly what passes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next he turned and addressed the natives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your names are Tamas, Tamala, and Hoba, and you, Tamas, are the son of
      the Molimo of Bambatse, who is called Mambo, and you, Tamala and Hoba, are
      his initiated councillors. Is it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They bowed their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. You, Tamas, tell the story and give again your message that this
      lady, the lady Benita, may hear it, for she has a part in the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We understand that she has a part,&rdquo; answered Tamas. &ldquo;We read in her face
      that she has the greatest part. Doubtless it is of her that the Spirit
      told my father. These, spoken by my mouth, are the words of the Molimo, my
      father, which we have travelled so far to deliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;When you two white men visited Bambatse four years ago, you asked of me,
      Mambo, to be admitted to the holy place, that you might look for the
      treasure there which the Portuguese hid in the time of my ancestor in the
      sixth generation. I refused to allow you to look, or even to enter the
      holy place, because I am by birth the guardian of that treasure, although
      I know not where it lies. But now I am in a great strait. I have news that
      Lobengula the usurper, who is king of the Matabele, has taken offence
      against me for certain reasons, among them that I did not send him a
      sufficient tribute. It is reported to me that he purposes next summer to
      despatch an impi to wipe me and my people out, and to make my kraal black
      as the burnt veld. I have little strength to resist him who is mighty, and
      my people are not warlike. From generation to generation they have been
      traders, cultivators of the land, workers in metal, and men of peace, who
      desire not to kill or be killed. Also they are few. Therefore I have no
      power to stand against Lobengula.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I remember the guns that you and your companion brought with you, which
      can kill things from far away. If I had a supply of those guns from behind
      my walls I might defy the impi of Lobengula, whose warriors use the
      assegai. If you will bring me a hundred good guns and plenty of powder and
      bullets for them, it is revealed to me that it will be lawful for me to
      admit you to the secret, holy place, where you may look for the buried
      gold for as long as you wish, and if you can find it, take it all away
      without hindrance from me or my people. But I will be honest with you.
      That gold will never be found save by the one appointed. The white lady
      said so in the time of my forefather; he heard it with his ears, and I
      have heard it from his descendants with my ears, and so it shall be.
      Still, if you bring the guns you can come and see if either of you is that
      one appointed. But I do not think that any man is so appointed, for the
      secret is hid in woman. But of this you can learn for yourselves. I do but
      speak as I am bidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This is my message spoken by my mouth, Tamas, son of my body, and my
      councillors who go with him will bear witness that he speaks the truth. I,
      Mambo, the Molimo of Bambatse, send you greeting, and will give you good
      welcome and fulfil my promise, if you come with the far-shooting guns, ten
      times ten of them, and the powder, and the bullets wherewith I may drive
      off the Matabele, but not otherwise. My son, Tamas, and my councillors
      will drive your waggon into my country but you must bring no strange
      servants. The Spirit of the white woman who killed herself before the eyes
      of my forefather has been seen of late standing upon the point of rock;
      also she has visited me at night in my secret place where her companions
      died. I do not know all that this portends, but I think that amongst other
      things she wished to tell me that the Matabele are about to attack us. I
      await the decree of the Heavens. I send you two karosses as a gift, and a
      little ancient gold, since ivory is too heavy for my messengers to carry,
      and I have no waggon. Farewell.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have heard you,&rdquo; said Meyer, when Mr. Clifford had finished
      translating, &ldquo;and we wish to ask you a question. What do you mean when you
      say that the Spirit of the white woman has been seen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean what I say, white man,&rdquo; answered Tamas. &ldquo;She was seen by all three
      of us, standing upon the pinnacle at the dawn; also my father saw and
      spoke with her alone in his sleep at night. This is the third time in my
      father&rsquo;s day that she has appeared thus, and always before some great
      event.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was she like?&rdquo; asked Meyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like? Oh! like the lady who sits yonder. Yes, quite the same, or so it
      seemed to us. But who knows? We have seen no other white women, and we
      were not very near. Let the lady come and stand side by side with the
      Spirit, so that we can examine them both, and we shall be able to answer
      better. Do you accept the offer of the Molimo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will tell you to-morrow morning,&rdquo; replied Meyer. &ldquo;A hundred rifles are
      many to find, and will cost much money. Meanwhile, for you there is food
      and a sleeping-place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three men seemed disappointed at his answer, which they evidently
      believed to be preliminary to a refusal. For a moment or two they
      consulted together, then Tamas put his hand into a pouch and drew from it
      something wrapped in dry leaves, which he undid, revealing a quaint and
      beautiful necklace, fashioned of twisted gold links, wherein were set
      white stones, that they had no difficulty in recognising as uncut diamonds
      of considerable value. From this necklace also hung a crucifix moulded in
      gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We offer this gift,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;on behalf of Mambo, my father, to the lady
      yonder, to whom the karosses and the rough gold are of no use. The chain
      has a story. When the Portuguese lady hurled herself into the river she
      wore it about her neck. As she fell into the river she struck against a
      little point of rock which tore the chain away from her&mdash;see where it
      is broken and mended with gold wire. It remained upon the point of rock,
      and my forefather took it thence. It is a gift to the lady if she will
      promise to wear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accept it,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Clifford, when he had finished translating this,
      &ldquo;or you will give offence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Benita said: &ldquo;I thank the Molimo, and accept his gift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Tamas rose, and, advancing, cast the ancient, tragic thing over her
      head. As it fell upon her shoulders, Benita knew that it was a chain of
      destiny drawing her she knew not where, this ornament that had last been
      worn by that woman, bereaved and unhappy as herself, who could find no
      refuge from her sorrow except in death. Had she felt it torn from her
      breast, she wondered, as she, the living Benita of to-day, felt it fall
      upon her own?
    </p>
    <p>
      The three envoys rose, bowed, and went, leaving them alone. Jacob Meyer
      lifted his head as though to address her, then changed his mind and was
      silent. Both the men waited for her to speak, but she would not, and in
      the end it was her father who spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, Benita?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? I have nothing to say, except that I have heard a very curious story.
      This priest&rsquo;s message is to you and Mr. Meyer, father, and must be
      answered by you. What have I to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal, I think, my dear, or so those men seemed to believe. At any
      rate, I cannot go up there without you, and I will not take you there
      against your wish, for it is a long way off, and a queer business. The
      question is, will you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thought a space, while the two men watched her anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered at length, in a quiet voice. &ldquo;I will go if you wish to
      go, not because I want to find treasure, but because the story and the
      country where it happened interest me. Indeed, I don&rsquo;t believe much in the
      treasure. Even if they are superstitious and afraid to look for it
      themselves, I doubt whether they would allow you to look if they thought
      it could be found. To me the journey does not seem a good business
      speculation, also there are risks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We think it good enough,&rdquo; broke in Meyer decidedly. &ldquo;And one does not
      expect to get millions without trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said her father; &ldquo;but she is right&mdash;there are risks,
      great risks&mdash;fever, wild beasts, savages, and others that one cannot
      foresee. Have I a right to expose her to them? Ought we not to go alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be useless,&rdquo; answered Meyer. &ldquo;Those messengers have seen your
      daughter, and mixed her up with their superstitious story of a ghost, of
      which I, who know that there are no such things, believe nothing. Without
      her now we shall certainly fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for the risks, father,&rdquo; said Benita, &ldquo;personally I take no account of
      them, for I am sure that what is to happen will happen, and if I knew that
      I was to die upon the Zambesi, it would make no difference to me who do
      not care. But as it chances, I think&mdash;I cannot tell you why&mdash;that
      you and Mr. Meyer are in more danger than I am. It is for you to consider
      whether you will take the risks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford smiled. &ldquo;I am old,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that is my answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am accustomed to such things,&rdquo; said Meyer, with a shrug of his
      shoulders. &ldquo;Who would not run a little danger for the sake of such a
      glorious chance? Wealth, wealth, more wealth than we can dream of, and
      with it, power&mdash;power to avenge, to reward, to buy position, and
      pleasure, and all beautiful things which are the heritage of the very rich
      alone,&rdquo; and he spread out his hands and looked upwards, as though in
      adoration of this golden god.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except such trifles as health and happiness,&rdquo; commented Benita, not
      without sarcasm, for this man and his material desires disgusted her
      somewhat, especially when she contrasted him with another man who was lost
      to her, though it was true that <i>his</i> past had been idle and
      unproductive enough. Yet they interested her also, for Benita had never
      met anyone like Mr. Meyer, so talented, so eager, and so soulless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I understand it is settled?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford hesitated, but Meyer answered at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, settled as far as anything can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited a moment for her father to speak, but he said nothing; his
      chance had gone by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Now we shall not need to trouble ourselves with further doubts
      or argument. We are going to Bambatse on the Zambesi, a distant place, to
      look for buried gold, and I hope, Mr. Meyer, that if you find it, the
      results will come up to your expectations, and bring you all sorts of good
      luck. Good-night, father dear, good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter thinks it will bring us ill-luck,&rdquo; said Mr. Clifford, when
      the door had closed behind her. &ldquo;That is her way of saying so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Meyer gloomily; &ldquo;she thinks that, and she is one of those
      who have vision. Well, she may be wrong. Also, the question is, shall we
      seize our opportunity and its dangers, or remain here and breed bad horses
      all our lives, while she who is not afraid laughs at us? I am going to
      Bambatse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Mr. Clifford made no direct answer, only asked a question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long will it take to get the guns and ammunition, and what will they
      cost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a week from Wakkerstroom,&rdquo; replied Meyer. &ldquo;Old Potgieter, the
      trader there, has just imported a hundred Martinis and a hundred
      Westley-Richards falling-blocks. Fifty of each, with ten thousand rounds
      of cartridges, will cost about £600, and we have as much as that in the
      bank; also we have the new waggon, and plenty of good oxen and horses. We
      can take a dozen of the horses with us, and sell them in the north of the
      Transvaal for a fine price, before we get into the tetsefly belt. The oxen
      will probably carry us through, as they are most of them salted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have thought it all out, Jacob, I see; but it means a lot of money
      one way and another, to say nothing of other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a lot of money, and those rifles are too good for Kaffirs.
      Birmingham gas-pipes would have done for them, but there are none to be
      had. But what is the money, and what are the guns, compared to all they
      will bring us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you had better ask my daughter, Jacob. She seems to have her own
      ideas upon the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Clifford has made up her mind, and it will not change. I shall ask
      her no more,&rdquo; replied Meyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he, too, left the room, to give orders about the journey to
      Wakkerstroom that he must take upon the morrow. But Mr. Clifford sat there
      till past midnight, wondering whether he had done right, and if they would
      find the treasure of which he had dreamed for years, and what the future
      had in store for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If only he could have seen!
    </p>
    <p>
      When Benita came to breakfast the next morning, she asked where Mr. Meyer
      was, and learned that he had already departed for Wakkerstroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly he is in earnest,&rdquo; she said with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered her father; &ldquo;Jacob is always in earnest, though, somehow,
      his earnestness has not brought him much good so far. If we fail, it will
      not be want of thought and preparation on his part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nearly a week went by before Meyer returned again, and meanwhile Benita
      made ready for her journey. In the intervals of her simple preparations
      also she talked a good deal, with the help of her father, to the three
      sturdy-looking Makalanga, who were resting thankfully after their long
      journey. Their conversation was general, since by tacit consent no further
      mention was made of the treasure or of anything to do with it, but it
      enabled her to form a fair opinion of them and their people. She gathered
      that although they spoke a dialect of Zulu, they had none of the bravery
      of the Zulus, and indeed lived in deadly terror of the Matabele, who are
      bastard Zulus&mdash;such terror, in fact, that she greatly doubted whether
      the hundred rifles would be of much use to them, should they ever be
      attacked by that tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were what their fathers had been before them, agriculturists and
      workers in metals&mdash;not fighting men. Also she set herself to learn
      what she could of their tongue, which she did not find difficult, for
      Benita had a natural aptitude for languages, and had never forgotten the
      Dutch and Zulu she used to prattle as a child, which now came back to her
      very fast. Indeed, she could already talk fairly in either of those
      languages, especially as she spent her spare hours in studying their
      grammar, and reading them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the days went on, till one evening Jacob Meyer appeared with two Scotch
      carts laden with ten long boxes that looked like coffins, and other
      smaller boxes which were very heavy, to say nothing of a multitude of
      stores. As Mr. Clifford prophesied, he had forgotten nothing, for he even
      brought Benita various articles of clothing, and a revolver for which she
      had not asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later they trekked away from Rooi Krantz upon a peculiarly
      beautiful Sunday morning in the early spring, giving it out that they were
      going upon a trading and shooting expedition in the north of the
      Transvaal. Benita looked back at the pretty little stead and the wooded
      kloof behind it over which she had nearly fallen, and the placid lake in
      front of it where the nesting wildfowl wheeled, and sighed. For to her,
      now that she was leaving it, the place seemed like home, and it came into
      her mind that she would never see it any more.

    <h3>
      BAMBATSE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Nearly four months had gone by when at length the waggon with which were
      Mr. Clifford, Benita, and Jacob Meyer camped one night within the country
      of the Molimo of Bambatse, whose name was Mambo. Or perhaps that was his
      title, since (according to Tamas his son) every chief in succession was
      called Mambo, though not all of them were Molimos, or representatives and
      prophets of God, or the Great Spirit whom they knew as Munwali. Thus
      sometimes the Molimo, or priest of Munwali, and the Mambo or chief were
      different persons. For instance, he said that he, Tamas, would be Mambo on
      his father&rsquo;s death, but no visions were given to him; therefore as yet, at
      any rate, he was not called to be Molimo.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of this long journey they had met with many adventures, such
      as were common to African travellers before the days of railroads;
      adventures with wild beasts and native tribes, adventures with swollen
      rivers also, and one that was worst, with thirst, since for three days
      (owing to the failure of a pit or pan, where they expected to find water)
      they were obliged to go without drink. Still, none of these were very
      serious, nor had any of the three of them ever been in better health than
      they were at this moment, for by good luck they had escaped all fever.
      Indeed, their rough, wild life had agreed with Benita extraordinarily
      well, so well that any who had known her in the streets of London would
      scarcely have recognized her as the sunburnt, active and well-formed young
      woman who sat that night by the camp fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the horses they had brought with them had been sold, except some which
      had died, and three that were &ldquo;salted,&rdquo; or proof against the deadly horse
      sickness, which they took on with them. Their own servants also had been
      sent back to Rooi Krantz in charge of a Scotch cart laden with ivory,
      purchased from Boer hunters who had brought it down from the north of the
      Transvaal. Therefore, for this was part of the bargain, the three
      Makalanga were now their only attendants who drove and herded the cattle,
      while Benita cooked the food which the two white men shot, or sometimes
      bought from natives.
    </p>
    <p>
      For days they had been passing through a country that was practically
      deserted, and now, having crossed a high nek, the same on which Robert
      Seymour had left his waggon, they were camped in low land which, as they
      could see by the remains of walls that appeared everywhere, had once been
      extensively enclosed and cultivated. To their right was a rising
      mountainous ground, beyond which, said the Makalanga, ran the Zambesi, and
      in front of them, not more than ten miles away, a great isolated hill,
      none other than that place that they had journeyed so far to reach,
      Bambatse, round which flowed the great river. Indeed, thither one of the
      three Makalanga, he who was named Hoba, had gone on to announce their
      approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had outspanned amongst ruins, most of them circular in shape, and
      Benita, studying them in the bright moonlight, guessed that once these had
      been houses. That place now so solitary, hundreds or thousands of years
      ago was undoubtedly the home of a great population. Thousands, rather than
      hundreds, she thought, since close at hand in the middle of one of these
      round houses, grew a mighty baobab tree, that could not have seen less
      than ten or fifteen centuries since the seed whence it sprang pierced the
      cement floor which was still visible about its giant bole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tamas, the Molimo&rsquo;s son, saw her studying these evidences of antiquity,
      and, approaching, saluted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he said in his own language, which by now she spoke very well,
      &ldquo;lady&rdquo;&mdash;and he waved his hand with a fine gesture&mdash;&ldquo;behold the
      city of my people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that it was their city?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, lady. Stones cannot speak, the spirits are silent, and we
      have forgotten. Still, I think so, and our fathers have told us that but
      six or eight generations ago many folk lived here, though it was not they
      who built these walls. Even fifty years ago there were many, but now the
      Matabele have killed them, and we are few; to-morrow you will see how few.
      Come here and look,&rdquo; and he led her through the entrance of a square
      cattle kraal which stood close by. Within were tufts of rank grass, and a
      few bushes, and among these scores of skulls and other bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Matabele killed these in the time of Moselikatse,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now do
      you wonder that we who remain fear the Matabele, and desire guns to defend
      ourselves from them, even if we must sell our secrets, in order to buy
      those guns, who have no money to pay for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, looking at the tall, dignified man, into whose soul
      the irons of fear and slavery had burnt so deep. &ldquo;No, I do not wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next morning at daybreak they trekked on, always through these evidences
      of dead, forgotten people. They had not more than ten miles to cover to
      reach their long journey&rsquo;s end, but the road, if so it could be called,
      ran up-hill, and the oxen, whereof only fourteen were now left to drag the
      heavy-laden waggon, were thin and footsore, so that their progress was
      very slow. Indeed, it was past midday when at length they began to enter
      what by apology might be called the town of Bambatse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we go away from this, it will have to be by water, I think, unless
      we can buy trek-cattle,&rdquo; said Meyer, looking at the labouring oxen with a
      doubtful eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clifford anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because several of those beasts have been bitten by tetsefly, like my
      horse, and the poison is beginning to work. I thought so last night, but
      now I am sure. Look at their eyes. It was down in that bit of bush veld
      eight days ago. I said that we ought not to camp there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment they came to the crest of the ridge, and on its further
      side saw the wonderful ruins of Bambatse close at hand. In front of them
      stood a hill jutting out, as it were into the broad waters of the Zambesi
      river, which, to a great extent, protected it upon three sides. The
      fourth, that opposite to them, except at one place where a kind of natural
      causeway led into the town, was also defended by Nature, since here for
      more than fifty feet in height the granite rock of the base of the hill
      rose sheer and unclimbable. On the mount itself, that in all may have
      covered eight or ten acres of ground, and surrounded by a deep donga or
      ditch, were three rings of fortifications, set one above the other, mighty
      walls which, it was evident, had been built by no modern hand. Looking at
      them Benita could well understand how it came about that the poor fugitive
      Portuguese had chosen this as their last place of refuge, and were
      overcome at length, not by the thousands of savages who followed and
      surrounded them, but by hunger. Indeed, the place seemed impregnable to
      any force that was not armed with siege guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the hither side of this natural fosse, which, doubtless, in ancient
      times had been filled with water led from the Zambesi, stood the village
      of the Bambatse Makalanga, a collection of seventy or eighty wretched
      huts, round, like those of their forefathers, but built of mud and thatch.
      About them lay the gardens, or square fields, that were well cultivated,
      and at this season rich with ripening corn. Benita, however, could see no
      cattle, and concluded, therefore, that these must be kept on the hill for
      safety, and within its walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the rough road they lumbered, and through the village, where the few
      women and children stared at them in a frightened way. Then they came to
      the causeway, which, on its further side, was blocked with thorns and
      rough stones taken from the ruins. While they waited for these to be
      removed by some men who now appeared, Benita looked at the massive,
      circular wall still thirty or forty feet in height, by perhaps twenty
      through its base, built of granite blocks without mortar, and ornamented
      with quaint patterns of other coloured stones. In its thickness she could
      see grooves, where evidently had once been portcullises, but these had
      disappeared long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a wonderful place,&rdquo; she said to her father. &ldquo;I am glad that I came.
      Have you been all over it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; only between the first and second walls, and once between the second
      and third. The old temple, or whatever it is, is on the top, and into that
      they would never admit us. It is there that the treasure lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That the treasure is supposed to lie,&rdquo; she answered with a smile. &ldquo;But,
      Father, what guarantee have you that they will do so now? Perhaps they
      will take the guns and show us the door&mdash;or rather the gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your daughter is right, there is none; and before a box is taken off the
      waggon we must get one,&rdquo; said Meyer. &ldquo;Oh! I know it is risky, and it would
      have been better to make sure first, but it is too late to talk of that
      now. Look, the stones are cleared. Trek on&mdash;trek!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The long waggon-whip cracked, the poor, tired-out oxen strained at the
      yokes, and on they went through the entrance of that fateful fortress that
      was but just wide enough to admit them. Inside lay a great open space,
      which, as they could see from the numerous ruins, had once been filled
      with buildings that now were half hidden by grass, trees, and creepers.
      This was the outer ring of the temple where, in ancient days, the priests
      and captains had their home. Travelling across it for perhaps a hundred
      and fifty yards, they came near the second wall, which was like the first,
      only not quite so solid, and saw that on a stretch of beaten ground, and
      seated in the shadow, for the day was hot, the people of Bambatse were
      gathered to greet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When within fifty yards they dismounted from the horses, which were left
      with the waggon in the charge of the Makalanga, Tamala. Then Benita taking
      her position between her father and Jacob Meyer, they advanced towards the
      ring of natives, of whom there may have been two hundred&mdash;all of them
      adult men.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they came, except one figure who remained seated with his back against
      the wall, the human circle stood up as a token of respect, and Benita saw
      that they were of the same stamp as the messengers&mdash;tall and
      good-looking, with melancholy eyes and a cowed expression, wearing the
      appearance of people who from day to day live in dread of slavery and
      death. Opposite to them was a break in the circle, through which Tamas led
      them, and as they crossed it Benita felt that all those people were
      staring at her with their sad eyes. A few paces from where the man
      crouched against the wall, his head hidden by a beautifully worked blanket
      that was thrown over it, were placed three well-carved stools. Upon these,
      at a motion from Tamas, they sat themselves down, and, as it was not
      dignified for them to speak first, remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be patient and forgive,&rdquo; said Tamas at length. &ldquo;My father, Mambo, prays
      to the Munwali and the spirits of his fathers that this coming of yours
      may be fortunate, and that a vision of those things that are to be may
      descend upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita, feeling nearly two hundred pairs of eyes concentrated upon her,
      wished that the vision might come quickly, but after a minute or two fell
      into tune with the thing, and almost enjoyed this strange experience.
      Those mighty ancient walls built by hands unknown, which had seen so much
      history and so much death; the silent, triple ring of patient, solemn men,
      the last descendants of a cultured race, the crouching figure hidden
      beneath the blanket, who imagined himself to be communicating with his god&mdash;it
      was all very strange, very well worth the seeing to one who had wearied of
      the monotony of civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look, the man stirred, and threw back his blanket, revealing a head white
      with age, a spiritual, ascetic face, so thin that every bone showed in it,
      and dark eyes which stared upwards unseeingly, like those of a person in a
      trance. Thrice he sighed, while his tribesmen watched him. Then he let his
      eyes fall upon the three white people seated in front of him. First he
      looked at Mr. Clifford, and his face grew troubled; then at Jacob Meyer,
      and it was anxious and alarmed. Lastly, he stared at Benita, and while he
      did so the dark eyes became calm and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White maiden,&rdquo; he said in a soft, low voice, &ldquo;for you, at least, I have
      good tidings. Though Death come near to you, though you see him on your
      right hand and your left, and in front of you and behind you, I say, fear
      not. Here you, who have known deep sorrow, shall find happiness and rest,
      O maiden, with whom goes the spirit of one pure and fair as you, who died
      so long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, while Benita wondered at his words, spoken with such sweet
      earnestness that although she believed nothing of them, they brought a
      kind of comfort to her, he looked once more at her father and Jacob Meyer,
      and, as it were with an effort, was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no pleasant prophecy for me, old friend,&rdquo; said Jacob, &ldquo;who have
      come so far to hear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At once the aged face grew inscrutable, all expression vanished behind a
      hundred wrinkles, and he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, white man&mdash;none that I am charged to deliver. Search the skies
      for yourself, you who are so wise, and read them if you can. Lords,&rdquo; he
      went on in another voice, &ldquo;I greet you in the name and presence of my
      children. Son Tamas, I greet you also; you have done your mission well.
      Listen, now&mdash;you are weary and would rest and eat; still, bear with
      me, for I have a word to say. Look around you. You see all my tribe, not
      twenty times ten above the age of boys, we who once were countless as the
      leaves on yonder trees in spring. Why are we dead? Because of the
      Amandabele, those fierce dogs whom, two generations ago, Moselikatse, the
      general of Chaka, brought up to the south of us, who ravish us and kill us
      year by year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not warlike, we who have outlived war and the lust of slaying. We
      are men of peace, who desire to cultivate the land, and to follow our arts
      which have descended to us from our ancestors, and to worship the Heavens
      above us, whither we depart to join the spirits of our forefathers. But
      they are fierce and strong and savage, and they come up and murder our
      children and old people, and take away the young women and the maidens to
      be slaves, and with them all our cattle. Where are our cattle? Lobengula,
      chief of the Amandabele, has them; scarce a cow is left to give milk to
      the sick or to the motherless babe. And yet he sends for cattle. Tribute,
      say his messengers, deliver tribute, or my impi will come and take it with
      your lives. But we have no cattle&mdash;all are gone. We have nothing left
      to us but this ancient mountain and the works built thereon, and a little
      corn on which we live. Yes, I say it&mdash;I, the Molimo&mdash;I whose
      ancestors were great kings&mdash;I who have still more wisdom in me than
      all the hosts of the Amandabele,&rdquo; and as he spoke the old man&rsquo;s grey head
      sank upon his breast and the tears ran down his withered cheeks, while his
      people answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mambo, it is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen again,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Lobengula threatens us, therefore I sent
      to these white men who were here before, saying that if they would bring
      me a hundred guns, and powder and ball, to enable us to beat off the
      Amandabele from behind these strong walls of ours, I would take them into
      the secret holy place where for six generations no white man has set a
      foot, and there suffer them to search for the treasure which is hid
      therein, no man knows where, that treasure which they asked leave to find
      four winters gone. We refused it then and drove them hence, because of the
      curse laid upon us by the white maid who died, the last of the Portuguese,
      who foretold her people&rsquo;s fate for us if we gave up the buried gold save
      to one appointed. My children, the Spirit of Bambatse has visited me; I
      have seen her and others have seen her, and in my sleep she said to me:
      &lsquo;Suffer the men to come and search, for with them is one of the blood to
      whom my people&rsquo;s wealth is given; and great is your danger, for many
      spears draw nigh.&rsquo; My children, I sent my son and other messengers on a
      far journey to where I knew the men dwelt, and they have returned after
      many months bringing those men with them, bringing with them also another
      of whom I knew nothing&mdash;yes, her who is appointed, her of whom the
      Spirit spoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he lifted his withered hand and held it towards Benita, saying: &ldquo;I
      tell you that yonder she sits for whom the generations have waited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; answered the Makalanga. &ldquo;It is the White Lady come again to
      take her own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; asked the Molimo, while they wondered at his strange speech,
      &ldquo;tell me, have you brought the guns?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; answered Mr. Clifford, &ldquo;they are there in the waggon, every one
      of them, the best that can be made, and with them ten thousand cartridges,
      bought at a great cost. We have fulfilled our share of the bargain; now
      will you fulfil yours, or shall we go away again with the guns and leave
      you to meet the Matabele with your assegais?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say you the agreement while we listen,&rdquo; answered the Molimo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Mr. Clifford. &ldquo;It is this: That you shall find us food and
      shelter while we are with you. That you shall lead us into the secret
      place at the head of the hill, where the Portuguese died, and the gold is
      hidden. That you shall allow us to search for that gold when and where we
      will. That if we discover the gold, or anything else of value to us, you
      shall suffer us to take it away, and assist us upon our journey, either by
      giving us boats and manning them to travel down the Zambesi, or in
      whatever fashion may be most easy. That you shall permit none to hurt,
      molest, or annoy us during our sojourn among you. Is that our contract?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite all of it,&rdquo; said the Molimo. &ldquo;There is this to add: first that
      you shall teach us how to use the guns; secondly, that you shall search
      for and find the treasure, if so it is appointed, without our help, since
      in this matter it is not lawful for us to meddle; thirdly, that if the
      Amandabele should chance to attack us while you are here, you shall do
      your best to assist us against their power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, then, expect attack?&rdquo; asked Meyer suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White man, we always expect attack. Is it a bargain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mr. Clifford and Jacob Meyer in one voice, the latter
      adding: &ldquo;the guns and the cartridges are yours. Lead us now to the hidden
      place. We have fulfilled our part; we trust to the honour of you and all
      your people to fulfil yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White Maiden,&rdquo; asked the Molimo, addressing Benita, &ldquo;do you also say that
      it is a bargain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What my father says, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the Molimo. &ldquo;Then, in the presence of my people, and in the
      name of the Munwali, I, Mambo, who am his prophet, declare that it is so
      agreed between us, and may the vengeance of the heavens fall upon those
      who break our pact! Let the oxen of the white men be outspanned, their
      horses fed, their waggon unloaded, that we may count the guns. Let food be
      brought into the guest-house also, and after they have eaten, I, who alone
      of all of you have ever entered it, will lead them to the holy place, that
      there they may begin to search for that which the white men desire from
      age to age&mdash;to find it if they can; if not, to depart satisfied and
      at peace.&rdquo;

    <h3>
      THE OATH OF MADUNA
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford and Meyer rose to return to the waggon in order to
      superintend the unyoking of the oxen and to give directions as to their
      herding, and the off-saddling of the horses. Benita rose also, wondering
      when the food that had been promised would be ready, for she was hungry.
      Meanwhile, the Molimo was greeting his son Tamas, patting his hand
      affectionately and talking to him, when suddenly Benita, who watched this
      domestic scene with interest, heard a commotion behind her. Turning to
      discover its cause, she perceived three great man clad in full war
      panoply, shields on their left arms, spears in their right hands, black
      ostrich plumes rising from the polished rings woven in their hair, black
      moochas about their middles, and black oxtails tied beneath their knees,
      who marched through the throng of Makalanga as though they saw them not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Matabele! The Matabele are on us!&rdquo; cried a voice; while other voices
      shouted, &ldquo;Fly to your walls!&rdquo; and yet others, &ldquo;Kill them! They are few.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the three men marched on unheeding till they stood before Mambo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you, and what do you seek?&rdquo; the old man asked boldly, though the
      fear that had taken hold of him at the sight of these strangers was
      evident enough, for his whole body shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you should know, chief of Bambatse,&rdquo; answered their spokesman with
      a laugh, &ldquo;for you have seen the like of us before. We are the children of
      Lobengula, the Great Elephant, the King, the Black Bull, the Father of the
      Amandabele, and we have a message for your ear, little Old Man, which,
      finding that you leave your gate open, we have walked in to deliver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak your message then, envoys of Lobengula, in my ear and in those of
      my people,&rdquo; said the Molimo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your people! Are these all your people?&rdquo; the spokesman replied
      contemptuously. &ldquo;Why then, what need was there for the indunas of the King
      to send so large an impi under a great general against you, when a company
      of lads armed with sticks would have served the turn? We thought that
      these were but the sons of your house, the men of your own family, whom
      you had called together to eat with the white strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Close the entrance in the wall,&rdquo; cried the Molimo, stung to fury by the
      insult; and a voice answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, it is already done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Matabele, who should have been frightened, only laughed again, and
      their spokesman said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, my brothers, he thinks to trap us who are but three. Well, kill on,
      Old Wizard, if you will, but know that if a hand is lifted, this spear of
      mine goes through your heart, and that the children of Lobengula die hard.
      Know also that then the impi which waits not far away will destroy you
      every one, man and woman, youth and maiden, little ones who hold the hand
      and infants at the breast; none shall be left&mdash;none at all, to say,
      &lsquo;Here once lived the cowardly Makalanga of Bambatse.&rsquo; Nay, be not foolish,
      but talk softly with us, so that perhaps we may spare your lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the three men placed themselves back to back, in such fashion that
      they faced every way, and could not be smitten down from behind, and
      waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not kill envoys,&rdquo; said the Molimo, &ldquo;but if they are foul-mouthed, I
      throw them out of my walls. Your message, men of the Amandabele.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you. Hearken now to the word of Lobengula.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the envoy began to speak, using the pronoun I as though it were the
      Matabele king himself who spoke to his vassal, the Makalanga chief: &ldquo;I
      sent to you last year, you slave, who dare to call yourself Mambo of the
      Makalanga, demanding a tribute of cattle and women, and warning you that
      if they did not come, I would take them. They did not come, but that time
      I spared you. Now I send again. Hand over to my messengers fifty cows and
      fifty oxen, with herds to drive them, and twelve maidens to be approved by
      them, or I wipe you out, who have troubled the earth too long, and that
      before another moon has waned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are the words of Lobengula,&rdquo; he concluded, and taking the horn
      snuff-box from the slit in his ear, helped himself, then insolently passed
      it to the Molimo.
    </p>
    <p>
      So great was the old chief&rsquo;s rage that, forgetting his self-control, he
      struck the box from the hand of his tormentor to the ground, where the
      snuff lay spilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so shall the blood of your people be spilled through your rash
      foolishness,&rdquo; said the messenger calmly, as he picked up the box, and as
      much of the snuff as he could save.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hearken,&rdquo; said the Molimo, in a thin, trembling voice. &ldquo;Your king demands
      cattle, knowing that all the cattle are gone, that scarce a cow is left to
      give drink to a motherless babe. He asks for maidens also, but if he took
      those he seeks we should have none left for our young men to marry. And
      why is this so? It is because the vulture, Lobengula, has picked us to the
      bone; yes, while we are yet alive he has torn the flesh from us. Year by
      year his soldiers have stolen and killed, till at last nothing is left of
      us. And now he seeks what we have not got to give, in order that he may
      force a quarrel upon us and murder us. There is nought left for us to give
      Lobengula. You have your answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; replied the envoy with a sneer. &ldquo;How comes it, then, that yonder
      I see a waggon laden with goods, and oxen in the yokes? Yes,&rdquo; he repeated
      with meaning, &ldquo;with goods whereof we have known the like at Buluwayo; for
      Lobengula also sometimes buys guns from white men, O! little Makalanga.
      Come now, give us the waggon with its load and the oxen and the horses,
      and though it be but a small gift, we will take it away and ask nothing
      more this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I give you the property of my guests, the white men?&rdquo; asked the
      Molimo. &ldquo;Get you gone, and do your worst, or you shall be thrown from the
      walls of the fortress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, but know that very soon we shall return and make an end of you, who
      are tired of these long and troublesome journeys to gather so little. Go,
      tend your corn, dwellers in Bambatse, for this I swear in the name of
      Lobengula, never shall you see it ripen more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the crowd of listening Makalanga trembled at his words, but in the old
      Molimo they seemed only to rouse a storm of prophetic fury. For a moment
      he stood staring up at the blue sky, his arms outstretched as though in
      prayer. Then he spoke in a new voice&mdash;a clear, quiet voice, that did
      not seem to be his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am the Molimo of the Bambatse Makalanga; I am the
      ladder between them and Heaven; I sit on the topmost bough of the tree
      under which they shelter, and there in the crest of the tree Munwali
      speaks with me. What to you are winds, to me are voices whispering in my
      spirit&rsquo;s ears. Once my forefathers were great kings, they were Mambos of
      all the land, and that is still my name and dignity. We lived in peace; we
      laboured, we did wrong to no man. Then you Zulu savages came upon us from
      the south-east and your path was red with blood. Year after year you
      robbed and you destroyed; you raided our cattle, you murdered our men, you
      took our maidens and our children to be your women and your slaves, until
      at length, of all this pit filled with the corn of life, there is left but
      a little handful. And this you say you will eat up also, lest it should
      fall into good ground and grow again. I tell you that I think it will not
      be so; but whether or no that happens, I have words for the ear of your
      king&mdash;a message for a message. Say to him that thus speaks the wise
      old Molimo of Bambatse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see him hunted like a wounded hyena through the rivers, in the deep
      bush, and over the mountain. I see him die in pain and misery; but his
      grave I see not, for no man shall know it. I see the white man take his
      land and all his wealth; yea, to them and to no son of his shall his
      people give the Bayéte, the royal salute. Of his greatness and his power,
      this alone shall remain to him&mdash;a name accursed from generation to
      generation. And last of all I see peace upon the land and upon my
      children&rsquo;s children.&rdquo; He paused, then added: &ldquo;For you, cruel dog that you
      are, this message also from the Munwali, by the lips of his Molimo. I lift
      no hand against you, but you shall not live to look again upon your king&rsquo;s
      face. Begone now, and do your worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the three Matabele seemed to be frightened, and Benita heard
      one of them say to his companions:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Wizard has bewitched us! He has bewitched the Great Elephant and all
      his people! Shall we kill him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But quickly shaking off his fears their spokesman laughed, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is what you have brought the white people here for, old traitor&mdash;to
      plot against the throne of Lobengula.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wheeled round and stared at Mr. Clifford and Jacob Meyer; then added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, Grey-beard and Black-Beard: I myself will put you both to such a
      death as you have never heard of, and as for the girl, since she is well
      favoured, she shall brew the king&rsquo;s beer, and be numbered amongst the
      king&rsquo;s wives&mdash;unless, indeed, he is pleased to give her to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In an instant the thing was done! At the man&rsquo;s words about Benita, Meyer,
      who had been listening to his threats and bombast unconcerned, suddenly
      seemed to awake. His dark eyes flashed, his pale face turned cruel.
      Snatching the revolver from his belt he seemed to point and fire it with
      one movement, and down&mdash;dead or dying&mdash;went the Matabele.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men did not stir, they only stared. Accustomed as they were to death in
      that wild land, the suddenness of this deed surprised them. The contrast
      between the splendid, brutal savage who had stood before them a moment
      ago, and the limp, black thing going to sleep upon the ground, was strange
      enough to move their imaginations. There he lay, and there, over him, the
      smoking pistol in his hand, Meyer stood and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benita felt that the act was just, and the awful punishment deserved. Yet
      that laugh of Jacob&rsquo;s jarred upon her, for in it she thought she heard the
      man&rsquo;s heart speaking; and oh, its voice was merciless! Surely Justice
      should not laugh when her sword falls!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold, now,&rdquo; said the Molimo in his still voice, pointing at the dead
      Matabele with his finger; &ldquo;do I speak lies, or is it true that this man
      shall not look more upon his king&rsquo;s face? Well, as it was with the
      servant, so it shall be with the lord, only more slowly. It is the decree
      of the Munwali, spoken by the voice of his Mouth, the Molimo of Bambatse.
      Go, children of Lobengula, and bear with you as an offering this
      first-fruit of the harvest that the white men shall reap among the
      warriors of his people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thin voice died away, and there was silence so intense that Benita
      thought she heard the scraping of the feet of a green lizard which crept
      across a stone a yard or two away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then of a sudden it ended. Of a sudden the two remaining Matabele turned
      and fled for their lives, and as, when dogs run, a flock of sheep will
      wheel about and pursue them, so did the Makalanga. They grabbed at the
      messengers with their hands, tearing their finery from them; they struck
      them with sticks, they pounded them with stones, till at length two
      bruised and bleeding men, finding all escape cut off, and led perhaps by
      some instinct, staggered back to where Benita stood horrified at this
      dreadful scene, and throwing themselves upon the ground, clutched at her
      dress and prayed for mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Move a little, Miss Clifford,&rdquo; said Meyer. &ldquo;Three of those brutes will
      not weigh heavier than one upon my conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, you shall not,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Mambo, these men are messengers;
      spare them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hearken to the voice of pity,&rdquo; said the old prophet, &ldquo;spoken in a place
      where pity never was, and not in vain. Let them go. Give mercy to the
      merciless, for she buys their lives with a prayer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will bring the others on us,&rdquo; muttered Tamas, and even old Mr.
      Clifford shook his head sadly. But the Molimo only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have spoken. Let them go. That which will befall must befall, and from
      this deed no ill shall come that would not have come otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear? Depart swiftly,&rdquo; said Benita, in Zulu.
    </p>
    <p>
      With difficulty the two men dragged themselves to their feet, and
      supporting each other, stood before her. One of them, a clever,
      powerful-faced man, whose black hair was tinged with grey, addressing
      himself to Benita, gasped:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me. That fool there,&rdquo; and he pointed to his dead companion, &ldquo;whose
      boasting brought his death upon him, was but a low fellow. I, who kept
      silence and let him talk, am Maduna, a prince of the royal house who
      justly deserve to die because I turned my back upon these dogs. Yet I and
      my brother here take life at your hands, Lady, who, now that I have had
      time to think, would refuse it at theirs. For, whether I stay or go does
      not matter. The impi waits; the slayers are beneath the walls. Those
      things which are decreed will happen; there, yonder old Wizard speaks
      true. Listen, Lady: should it chance that you have cause to demand two
      lives at the hands of Maduna, in his own name and the name of his king he
      promises them to you. In safety shall they pass, they and all that is
      theirs, without toll taken. Remember the oath of Maduna, Lady, in the hour
      of your need, and do you, my brother, bear witness to it among our
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, straightening themselves as well as they were able, these two sorely
      hurt men lifted their right arms and gave Benita the salute due to a
      chieftainess. This done, taking no note of any other creature there, they
      limped away to the gate that had been opened for them, and vanished beyond
      the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while Meyer had stood silent; now he spoke with a bitter smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charity, Miss Clifford, said a certain Paul, as reported in your New
      Testament, covers a multitude of sins. I hope very much that it will serve
      to cover our remains from the aasvogels, after we have met our deaths in
      some such fashion as that brute promised us,&rdquo; and he pointed to the dead
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benita looked at her father in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Meyer means, my dear, that you have done a foolish thing in begging
      the lives of those Matabele. It would have been safer for us if they were
      dead, who, as it is, have gone off burning for revenge. Of course, I
      understand it was natural enough, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and he hesitated and
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chief did not say so,&rdquo; broke in Benita with agitation; &ldquo;besides, if
      he had, I should not have cared. It was bad enough to see one man killed
      like that,&rdquo; and she shivered; &ldquo;I could not bear any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should not be angry at the fellow&rsquo;s death, seeing that it was what he
      said of you which brought it upon him,&rdquo; Meyer replied with meaning.
      &ldquo;Otherwise he might have gone unharmed as far as I was concerned. For the
      rest, I did not interfere because I saw it was useless; also I am a
      fatalist like our friend, the Molimo, and believe in what is decreed. The
      truth is,&rdquo; he added sharply, &ldquo;among savages ladies are not in place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not say that down at Rooi Krantz, Jacob?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clifford.
      &ldquo;You know I thought so all the while, but somehow I was over-ruled. Now
      what I suggest is, that we had better get out of this place as fast as we
      can&mdash;instantly, as soon as we have eaten, before our retreat is cut
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meyer looked at the oxen which had been outspanned: nine were wandering
      about picking up what food they could, but the five which were supposed to
      have been bitten by tetsefly had lain down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine worn-out and footsore oxen will not draw the waggon,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;also
      in all probability the place is already surrounded by Matabele, who merely
      let us in to be sure of the guns which their spies must have told them we
      were carrying. Lastly, having spent so much and come so far, I do not mean
      to go without what we seek. Still, if you think that your daughter&rsquo;s
      danger is greater within these walls than outside of them, you might try,
      if we can hire servants, which I doubt. Or possibly, if any rowers are to
      be had, you could go down the Zambesi in a canoe, risking the fever. You
      and she must settle it, Clifford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Difficulties and dangers every way one looks. Benita, what do you say?&rdquo;
       asked her father distractedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benita thought a moment. She wished to escape from Mr. Meyer, of whom she
      was weary and afraid, and would have endured much to do so. On the other
      hand, her father was tired out, and needed rest; also to turn his back
      upon this venture now would have been a bitter blow to him. Moreover,
      lacking cattle and men, how was it to be done? Lastly, something within
      her, that same voice which had bidden her to come, seemed to bid her to
      stay. Very soon she had made up her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;thank you for thinking of me, but as far as I
      can see, we should run more risks trying to get away than we do in
      stopping here. I wanted to come, though you warned me against it, and now
      I must take my chance and trust to God to bring us safe through all
      dangers. Surely with all those rifles the Makalanga ought to be able to
      hold such a place as this against the Matabele.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; answered her father; &ldquo;but they are a timid folk. Still,
      though it would have been far better never to have come, I think with you
      that it is best to stay where we are, and trust to God.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h3>
      THE MOUNTAIN TOP
    </h3>
    <p>
      If our adventurers, or any of them, hoped that they were going to be led
      to the secret places of the fortress that day, they were destined to
      disappointment. Indeed, the remainder of it was employed arduously enough
      in unpacking rifles, and a supply of ammunition; also in giving to a few
      of the leading Makalanga preliminary lessons in the method of their use, a
      matter as to which their ideas were of the vaguest. The rest of the tribe,
      having brought their women and children into the outer enclosure of the
      ancient stronghold, and with them their sheep and goats and the few cattle
      which remained to them, were employed in building up the entrance
      permanently with stones, a zigzag secret path upon the river side, that
      could be stopped in a few minutes, being now their only method of ingress
      and egress through the thickness of the walls. A certain number of men
      were also sent out as spies to discover, if possible, the whereabouts of
      the Matabele impi.
    </p>
    <p>
      That there was some impi they were almost sure, for a woman who had
      followed them reported that the injured captain, Maduna, and his companion
      had been met at a distance of about three miles from Bambatse by a small
      party of Matabele, who were hiding in some bushes, and that these men had
      made litters for them, and carried them away; whither she did not know,
      for she had not dared to pursue them further.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Benita passed in the guesthouse, which was only a hut rather
      larger than the others, while the two men slept in the waggon just
      outside. She was so tired that for a long while she could not rest. Her
      mind kept flying back to all the events of the day: the strange words of
      that mystic old Molimo, concerning herself; the arrival of the brutal
      messengers and the indaba that followed; then the sudden and awful
      destruction of their spokesman at the hand of Jacob Meyer. The scene would
      not leave her eyes, she saw it again and yet again: the quick
      transformation of Meyer&rsquo;s indifferent face when the soldier began to
      insult and threaten her, the lightning-like movement of his hand, the
      flash, the report, the change from life to death, and the slayer&rsquo;s cruel
      laugh. He could be very terrible, Jacob Meyer, when his passions were
      roused!
    </p>
    <p>
      And what had roused them then? She could not doubt that it was herself&mdash;not
      mere chivalry towards a woman. Even if he were capable of chivalry, merely
      for that he would never have taken such risk of future trouble and
      revenge. No; it was something deeper. He had never said anything or done
      anything, yet long ago instinct or insight had caused Benita to suspect
      the workings of his mind, and now she was sure of them. The thought was
      terrible&mdash;worse than all her other dangers put together. True, she
      had her father to rely on, but he had been somewhat ailing of late; age
      and these arduous journeys and anxieties had told upon him. Supposing that
      anything were to happen to him&mdash;if he died, for instance, how
      dreadful her position might become, left alone far from the reach of help,
      with savages&mdash;and Jacob Meyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! if it had not been for that dreadful shipwreck, how different might be
      her lot to-day! Well, it was the thought of the shipwreck and of him whom
      she had lost therein, which had driven her on to this adventure, that in
      it perhaps her suffering mind might be numbed to rest; and now she must
      face its issues. God still remained above her, and she would put her trust
      in Him. After all, if she died, what did it matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      But that old Molimo had promised her that she was safe from death, that
      she should find here happiness and rest, though not that of the grave. He
      promised this, speaking as one who knew of all her grief, and a very
      little while afterwards, in the case of the Matabele soldier, he had
      proved himself a prophet of awful power. Also&mdash;she knew not how, she
      knew not why&mdash;now, as before, her inmost heart seemed to bear witness
      that this old dreamer&rsquo;s words were true, and that for her, in some strange
      manner unforeseen, there still remained a rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comforted a little by this intuition, at length Benita fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, when she came out of the hut, Benita was met by her father,
      who with a cheerful countenance informed her that at any rate as yet there
      was no sign of the Matabele. A few hours later, too, some spies came in
      who said that for miles round nothing could be seen or heard of them.
      Still the preparations for defence went on, and the hundred best men
      having been furnished with the rifles, were being drilled in the use of
      them by Tamas and his two companions, Tamala and Hoba, who had learned how
      to handle a gun very well in the course of their long journey. The
      shooting of these raw recruits, however, proved to be execrable; indeed,
      so dangerous were they that when one of them fired at a mark set upon the
      wall, it was found necessary to order all the rest to lie down. As it was,
      a poor trek ox&mdash;luckily it was sick&mdash;and two sheep were killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foreseeing a scarcity of provisions in the event of a siege, Meyer,
      provident as ever, had already decreed the death of the tetse-bitten
      cattle. These were accordingly despatched, and having been skinned and cut
      up, their flesh was severed into long strips to be dried in the burning
      sun as biltong, which secretly Benita hoped she might never be called upon
      to eat. Yet the time was to come when she would swallow that hard,
      tetse-poisoned flesh with thankfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midday, after they had eaten, Mr. Clifford and Meyer went to the
      Molimo, where he sat against the second wall, and, pointing to the men
      with the guns, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have fulfilled our bargain. Now fulfil yours. Lead us to the holy
      place that we may begin our search.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Follow me, white people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, quite unattended, he guided them round the inner wall till they came
      to a path of rock not more than a yard wide, beneath which was a precipice
      fifty feet or so in depth that almost overhung the river. This giddy path
      they followed for about twenty paces, to find that it ended in a cleft in
      the wall so narrow that only one person could walk through it at a time.
      That it must have been the approach to the second stronghold was evident,
      however, since it was faced on either side with dressed stones, and even
      the foundation granite had been worn by the human feet which had passed
      here for ages upon ages. This path zigzagged to and fro in the thickness
      of the wall till it brought them finally within its circle, a broad belt
      of steeply-rising ground, covered like that below with the tumbled ruins
      of buildings amidst which grew bush and trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven send that the gold is not buried here,&rdquo; said Mr. Clifford,
      surveying the scene; &ldquo;for if it is, we shall never find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Molimo seemed to guess the meaning of his words from his face, for he
      answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not here. The besiegers won this place and camped in it for many
      weeks. I could show you were they built their fires and tried to undermine
      the last wall within which the Portuguese sat about until hunger killed
      them, for they could not eat their gold. Follow me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So on they went up the slope till they came to the base of the third wall,
      and as before, passed round it, and reached a point above the river. But
      now there was no passage, only some shallow and almost precipitous steps
      cut from single stones leading from the foot of the wall to its summit,
      more than thirty feet above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said Benita, contemplating this perilous ascent with dismay,
      &ldquo;the ways of treasure seekers are hard. I don&rsquo;t think I can,&rdquo; while her
      father also looked at them and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must get a rope,&rdquo; said Meyer to the Molimo angrily. &ldquo;How can we climb
      that place without one, with such a gulf below?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am old, but I climb it,&rdquo; said the aged man in mild surprise, since to
      him, who had trodden it all his life, it seemed not difficult. &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;I have a rope above which I use upon dark nights. I will ascend
      and let it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ascend he did accordingly; indeed, it was a wondrous sight to see his
      withered legs scrambling from step to step as unconcernedly as though he
      were going upstairs. No monkey could have been more agile, or more
      absolutely impervious to the effects of height. Soon he vanished in&mdash;or,
      rather, through&mdash;the crest of the wall, and presently appeared again
      on the top step, whence he let down a stout hide rope, remarking that it
      was securely tied. So anxious was Meyer to enter the hidden place of which
      he had dreamed so long that he scarcely waited for it to reach his hand
      before he began the climb, which he accomplished safely. Then, sitting on
      the top of the wall, he directed Mr. Clifford to fasten the end of the
      rope round Benita&rsquo;s waist, and her turn came.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not so bad as she expected, for she was agile, and the knowledge
      that the rope would prevent disaster gave her confidence. In a very little
      while she had grasped Meyer&rsquo;s outstretched hand, and been drawn into
      safety through a kind of aperture above the top step. Then the rope was
      let down again for her father, who tied it about his middle. Well was it
      that he did so, since when he was about half-way up, awkwardness, or
      perhaps loss of nerve&mdash;neither of them wonderful in an old man&mdash;caused
      his foot to slip, and had it not been for the rope which Meyer and the
      Molimo held, he would certainly have fallen into the river some hundreds
      of feet below. As it was, he recovered himself, and presently arrived
      panting and very pale. In her relief Benita kissed him, and even as she
      did so thought again that she had been very near to being left alone with
      Jacob Meyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well that ends well, my dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But upon my word I am
      beginning to wish that I had been content with the humble profits of
      horse-breeding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita made no answer; it seemed too late for any useful consideration of
      the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clever men, those ancients,&rdquo; said Meyer. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; and he pointed out to her
      how, by drawing a heavy stone which still lay close by over the aperture
      through which they had crept, the ascent of the wall could be made
      absolutely impossible to any enemy, since at its crest it was battened
      outwards, not inwards, as is usual in these ancient ruins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;we ought to feel safe enough inside here, and that&rsquo;s
      as well since I do not feel inclined to go out again at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they paused to look about them, and this was what they saw:
    </p>
    <p>
      The wall, built like those below, of unmortared blocks of stone, remained
      in a wonderfully good state of preservation, for its only enemies had been
      time, the tropical rains, and the growth of shrubs and trees which here
      and there had cracked and displaced the stones. It enclosed all the top of
      the hill, perhaps three acres of ground, and on it at intervals were
      planted soap-stone pillars, each of them about twelve feet in height, and
      fashioned at the top to a rude resemblance of a vulture. Many of these
      columns, however had been blown down, or perhaps struck by lightning, and
      lay broken upon the wall, or if they had fallen inward, at its foot; but
      some, six or eight perhaps, were still standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benita learned afterwards that they must have been placed there by the
      ancient Phoenicians, or whatever people constructed this gigantic
      fortification, and had something to do with the exact recordings of the
      different seasons of the year, and their sub-divisions, by means of the
      shadows which they cast. As yet, however, she did not pay much attention
      to them, for she was engaged in considering a more remarkable relic of
      antiquity which stood upon the very verge of the precipice, the wall,
      indeed, being built up to its base on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the great cone of which Richard Seymour had told her, fifty feet
      high or more, such as once was found in the Phoenician temples. But in
      this case it was not built of masonry, but shaped by the hand of man out
      of a single gigantic granite monolith of the sort that are sometimes to be
      met with in Africa, that thousands or millions of years ago had been left
      standing thus when the softer rock around it was worn away by time and
      weather. On the inner side of this cone were easy steps whereby it could
      be ascended, and its top, which might have been six feet in diameter, was
      fashioned in the shape of a cup, probably for the purposes of acts of
      worship and of sacrifice. This extraordinary monument, which, except on
      the river side, could not be seen from below on account of the slope of
      the hill, leaned slightly outwards, so that a stone dropped from its crest
      would fall into the waters of the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thence it was,&rdquo; said the Molimo, &ldquo;that my forefathers saw the last of the
      Portuguese, the fair daughter of the great Captain Ferreira, hurl herself
      to death after she had given the gold into our keeping, and laid the curse
      upon it, until she came again. So in my dreams have I seen and heard her
      also, ay, and others have seen her, but these only from by the river far
      below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused awhile, looking at Benita with his queer, dreamy eyes; then said
      suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Lady, do you remember nothing of that matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Benita grew vexed, for the whole thing was uncanny and jarred upon
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I remember,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;who was born not five and twenty years
      ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;How should I know, who am but an ignorant
      old black man, who was born not much more than eighty years ago? Yet,
      Lady, tell me, for I seek your wisdom, where were you born from? Out of
      the earth, or out of the heavens? What? You shake your head, you who do
      not remember? Well, neither do I remember. Yet it is true that all circles
      meet somewhere, and it is true that the Portuguese maiden said she would
      come again; and lastly it is true that she was such an one as you are, for
      she haunts this place, and I, who have seen her sitting yonder in the
      moonlight, know her beauty well. Yet mayhap she comes no more in flesh,
      but still her spirit comes; for, Lady, out of those eyes of yours I see it
      gaze at me. Come,&rdquo; he added abruptly, &ldquo;let us descend the wall, for as you
      cannot remember, there is more to show you. Have no fear&mdash;the steps
      are easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they went down without much difficulty, since, from the accumulation of
      rubbish and other causes, the wall was a great deal lower on this side,
      and found themselves in the usual dense growth of vegetation and brushwood
      through which ran a little path. It led them past the ruins of buildings
      whereof the use and purpose were long since forgotten, for their roofs had
      fallen in hundreds or thousands of years ago, to the entrance of a cave
      which was placed almost at the foot of the monolithic cone, but thirty or
      forty yards further from the circle of the wall. Here the Molimo bade them
      stay while he lit the lamps within. Five minutes passed and he returned,
      saying that all was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be not afraid of what you may see,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;for know, white people,
      that save my forefathers and myself, none have entered this place since
      the Portuguese perished here, nor have we, who do but come hither to pray
      and receive the word of the Munwali, ever ventured to disturb it. As it
      was, so it is. Come, Lady, come; she whose spirit goes with you was the
      last of your white race to pass this door. It is therefore fitting that
      your feet and her spirit should be the first to enter it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita hung back a little, for the adventure was eerie, then, determined
      that she would show no fear in the presence of this old priest, took the
      thin hand he stretched out to her, and walked forward with head erect. The
      two men began to follow her, but the Molimo stopped them, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so. The maiden enters first alone with me; it is her house, and
      should it please her to ask you to dwell therein, so be it. But first she
      must visit her house alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Mr. Clifford angrily. &ldquo;I will not have it. It will
      frighten her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady, do you trust me?&rdquo; asked the Molimo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered; adding, &ldquo;Father, I think you had better let me go
      alone. I am not afraid now, and it may be wisest not to thwart him. This
      is a very strange business&mdash;not like anything else&mdash;and really I
      think that I had better go alone. If I do not come back presently, you can
      follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who break in upon the sleep of the dead should walk gently,
      gently,&rdquo; piped the old Molimo in a sing-song voice. &ldquo;The maiden&rsquo;s breath
      is pure; the maiden&rsquo;s foot is light; her breath will not offend the dead;
      her step will not disturb the dead. White men, white men, anger not the
      dead, for the dead are mighty, and will be revenged upon you when you are
      dead; soon, very soon, when you are dead&mdash;dead in your sorrows, dead
      in your sins, dead, gathered to that company of the dead who await us
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, still chanting his mystic song, he led Benita by the hand out of the
      light, onward into darkness, away from life, onward into the place of
      death.

      XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE SLEEPERS IN THE CAVE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Like every other passage in this old fortress, the approach to the cave
      was narrow and winding; presumably the ancients had arranged them thus to
      facilitate their defence. After the third bend, however, Benita saw a
      light ahead which flowed from a native lamp lit in the arched entrance. At
      the side of this arch was a shell-shaped hollow, cut in the rock about
      three feet above the floor. Its appearance seemed familiar to her; why,
      she was soon to learn, although at the moment she did not connect it with
      anything in particular. The cave beyond was large, lofty, and not
      altogether natural, for its walls had evidently been shaped, or at any
      rate trimmed, by man. Probably here the old Priests had established their
      oracle, or place of offering.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Benita could not see much, since in that great cavern two lamps
      of hippopotamus oil gave but little light. Presently, however, her eyes
      became accustomed to the gloom, and as they advanced up its length she
      perceived that save for a skin rug upon which she guessed the Molimo sat
      at his solitary devotions, and some gourds and platters for water and
      food, all the front part of the place appeared to be empty. Beyond, in its
      centre, stood an object of some gleaming metal, that from its double
      handles and roller borne upon supports of rock she took to be some kind of
      winch, and rightly, for beneath it was the mouth of a great well, the
      water supply of the topmost fortification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the well was a stone altar, shaped like a truncated cone or
      pyramid, and at some distance away against the far wall, as she dimly
      discovered by the lamp that stood upon the altar, cut in relief upon that
      wall indeed, a colossal cross to which, vigorously if rudely executed in
      white stone, hung the image of Christ crucified, the crown of thorns upon
      His drooping head. Now she understood. Whatever may have been the first
      worship to which this place was dedicated, Christians had usurped it, and
      set up here the sacred symbol of their faith, awful enough to look upon in
      such surroundings. Doubtless, also, the shell-shaped basin at the entrance
      had served the worshippers in this underground chapel as a stoup for holy
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Molimo lifted the lamp from the altar, and having adjusted its wick,
      held it up in front of the rood before which, although she was no
      Catholic, Benita bowed her head and crossed herself, while he watched her
      curiously. Then he lowered it, and she perceived that on the cemented
      floor lay great numbers of shrouded forms that at first looked to her like
      folk asleep. He stepped to one of them and touched it with his foot,
      whereon the cloth which with it was covered crumbled into dust, revealing
      beneath a white skeleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      All those sleepers rested well indeed, for they had been dead at least two
      hundred years. There they lay&mdash;men, women, and children, though of
      the last but few. Some of them had ornaments on their bones, some were
      clad in armour, and by all the men were swords, or spears, or knives, and
      here and there what she took to be primitive fire-arms. Certain of them
      also had turned into mummies in that dry air&mdash;grotesque and dreadful
      objects from which she gladly averted her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Molimo led her forward to the foot of the crucifix, where, upon its
      lowest step and upon the cemented floor immediately beneath it
      respectively, lay two shapes decorously covered with shawls of some heavy
      material interwoven with gold wire, for the manufacture of which the
      Makalanga were famous when first the Portuguese came into contact with
      them. The Molimo took hold of the cloths that seemed almost as good now as
      on the day when they were woven, and lifted them, revealing beneath the
      figures of a man and woman. The features were unrecognizable, although the
      hair, white in the man&rsquo;s case and raven black in that of the woman,
      remained perfect. They had been great people, for orders glittered upon
      the man&rsquo;s breast, and his sword was gold hilted, whilst the woman&rsquo;s bones
      were adorned with costly necklaces and jewels, and in her hand was still a
      book bound in sheets of silver. Benita took it up and looked at it. It was
      a missal beautifully illuminated, which doubtless the poor lady had been
      reading when at length she sank exhausted into the sleep of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See the Lord Ferreira and his wife,&rdquo; said the Molimo, &ldquo;whom their
      daughter laid thus before she went to join them.&rdquo; Then, at a motion from
      Benita, he covered them up again with their golden cloths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here they sleep,&rdquo; he went on in his chanting voice, &ldquo;a hundred and fifty
      and three of them&mdash;a hundred and fifty and three; and when I dream in
      this place at night, I have seen the ghosts of every one of them arise
      from beside their forms and come gliding down the cave&mdash;the husband
      with the wife, the child with the mother&mdash;to look at me, and ask when
      the maiden returns again to take her heritage and give them burial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita shuddered; the solemn awfulness of the place and scene oppressed
      her. She began to think that she, too, saw those ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is enough,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let us be going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they went, and the pitiful, agonized Christ upon the cross, at which
      she glanced from time to time over her shoulder, faded to a white blot,
      then vanished away in the darkness, through which, from generation to
      generation, it kept its watch above the dead, those dead that in their
      despair once had cried to it for mercy, and bedewed its feet with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glad, oh! glad was she when she had left that haunted place behind her,
      and saw the wholesome light again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you seen?&rdquo; asked her father and Meyer, in one breath, as they
      noted her white and frightened face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank upon a stone seat at the entrance of the cave, and before she
      could open her lips the Molimo answered for her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The maiden has seen the dead. The Spirit who goes with her has given
      greeting to its dead that it left so long ago. The maiden has done
      reverence to the White One who hangs upon the cross, and asked a blessing
      and a pardon of Him, as she whose Spirit goes with her did reverence
      before the eyes of my forefathers, and asked a blessing and a pardon ere
      she cast herself away.&rdquo; And he pointed to the little golden crucifix which
      hung upon Benita&rsquo;s bosom, attached to the necklace which Tamas, the
      messenger, had given her at Rooi Krantz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;now the spell is broken, and the sleepers must depart
      to sleep elsewhere. Enter, white men; enter, if you dare, and ask for
      pardon and for blessing if it may be found, and gather up the dry bones
      and take the treasure that was theirs, if it may be found, and conquer the
      curse that goes with the treasure for all save one, if you can, if you
      can, if you can! Rest you here, maiden, in the sweet sunshine, and follow
      me, white men; follow me into the dark of the dead to seek for that which
      the white men love.&rdquo; And once more he vanished down the passage, turning
      now and again to beckon to them, while they went after him as though drawn
      against their wish. For now, at the last moment, some superstitious fear
      spread from him to them, and showed itself in their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Benita, half fainting upon the stone seat, for this experience had
      shaken her to the heart, it seemed but a few minutes, though really the
      best part of an hour had gone by, when her father reappeared as
      white-faced as she had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mr. Meyer?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;He is collecting all the golden ornaments off those
      poor bodies, and tumbling their bones together in a corner of the cave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita uttered an exclamation of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;But, curse the fellow! he has no
      reverence, although at first he seemed almost as scared as I was myself.
      He said that as we could not begin our search with all those corpses
      about, they had best be got out of the way as soon as possible. Or perhaps
      it was because he is really afraid of them, and wanted to prove to himself
      that they are nothing more than dust. Benita,&rdquo; went on the old man, &ldquo;to
      tell you the truth, I wish heartily that we had left this business alone.
      I don&rsquo;t believe that any good will come of it, and certainly it has
      brought enough trouble already. That old prophet of a Molimo has the
      second sight, or something like it, and he does not hide his opinion, but
      keeps chuckling away in that dreadful place, and piping out his promises
      of ill to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He promised me nothing but good,&rdquo; said Benita with a little smile.
      &ldquo;Though I don&rsquo;t see how it can happen. But if you dislike the thing,
      father, why not give it up and try to escape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too late, dear,&rdquo; he replied passionately. &ldquo;Meyer would never come,
      and I can&rsquo;t in honour leave him. Also, I should laugh at myself for the
      rest of my life; and, after all, why should we not have the gold if it can
      be found? It belongs to nobody. We do not get it by robbery, or murder;
      nuggets are of no use to Portuguese who have been dead two hundred years,
      and whose heirs, if they have any, it is impossible to discover. Nor can
      it matter to them whether they lie about singly as they died or were
      placed after death, or piled together in a corner. Our fears were mere
      churchyard superstitions, which we have caught from that ghoul of a
      Molimo. Don&rsquo;t you agree with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; answered Benita, &ldquo;though a fate may cling to certain
      things or places, perhaps. At any rate, I think that it is of no use
      turning back now, even if we had anywhere to turn, so we may as well go
      through with the venture and await its end. Give me the water-bottle,
      please. I am thirsty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A while later Jacob Meyer appeared, carrying a great bundle of precious
      objects wrapped in one of the gold cere-cloths, which bundle he hid away
      behind a stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cave is much tidier now,&rdquo; he said, as he flicked the thick dust which
      had collected on them during his unhallowed task from his hands, and hair,
      and garments. Then he drank greedily, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you two made any plans for our future researches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I have. I thought them out while I was bone-carting, and here
      they are. It is no use our going down below again; for one thing, the
      journey is too dangerous, and takes too long; and for another, we are
      safer up above, where we have plenty to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Benita, &ldquo;how about things to eat and sleep on, and the rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simple enough, Miss Clifford; we must get them up. The Kaffirs will bring
      them to the foot of the third wall, and we will haul them to its top with
      a rope. Of water it seems there is plenty in that well, which is fed by a
      spring a hundred and fifty feet down, and the old chain is still on the
      roller, so we only need a couple of buckets from the waggon. Of wood for
      cooking there is plenty also, growing on the spot; and we can camp in the
      cave or outside of it, as we like, according to the state of the weather.
      Now, do you rest here while I go down. I will be back in an hour with some
      of the gear, and then you must help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he went, and the end of it was that before nightfall they had enough
      things for their immediate needs, and by the second night, working very
      hard, were more or less comfortably established in their strange
      habitation. The canvas flap from the waggon was arranged as a tent for
      Benita, the men sleeping beneath a thick-leaved tree near by. Close at
      hand, under another tree, was their cooking place. The provisions of all
      sorts, including a couple of cases of square-face and a large supply of
      biltong from the slaughtered cattle, they stored with a quantity of
      ammunition in the mouth of the cave. Fresh meat also was brought to them
      daily, and hauled up in baskets&mdash;that is, until there was none to
      bring&mdash;and with it grain for bread, and green mealies to serve as
      vegetables. Therefore, as the water from the well proved to be excellent
      and quite accessible, they were soon set up in all things necessary, and
      to these they added from time to time as opportunity offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all these preparations the old Molimo took a part, nor, when they were
      completed, did he show any inclination to leave them. In the morning he
      would descend to his people below, but before nightfall he always returned
      to the cave, where for many years it had been his custom to sleep&mdash;at
      any rate several times a week, in the gruesome company of the dead
      Portuguese. Jacob Meyer persuaded Mr. Clifford that his object was to spy
      upon them, and talked of turning him out; but Benita, between whom and the
      old man had sprung up a curious friendship and sympathy, prevented it,
      pointing out that they were much safer with the Molimo, as a kind of
      hostage, than they could be without him; also, that his knowledge of the
      place, and of other things, might prove of great help to them. So in the
      end he was allowed to remain, as indeed he had a perfect right to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while there was no sign of any attack by the Matabele. Indeed,
      the fear of such a thing was to some extent dying away, and Benita,
      watching from the top of the wall, could see that their nine remaining
      oxen, together with the two horses&mdash;for that belonging to Jacob Meyer
      had died&mdash;and the Makalanga goats and sheep, were daily driven out to
      graze; also, that the women were working in the crops upon the fertile
      soil around the lowest wall. Still, a strict watch was kept, and at night
      everyone slept within the fortifications; moreover, the drilling of the
      men and their instruction in the use of firearms went on continually under
      Tamas, who now, in his father&rsquo;s old age, was the virtual chief of the
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the fourth morning that at length, all their preparations being
      completed, the actual search for the treasure began. First, the Molimo was
      closely interrogated as to its whereabouts, since they thought that even
      if he did not know this exactly, some traditions of the fact might have
      descended to him from his ancestors. But he declared with earnestness that
      he knew nothing, save that the Portuguese maiden had said that it was
      hidden; nor, he added, had any dream or vision come to him concerning this
      matter, in which he took no interest. If it was there, it was there; if it
      was not there, it was not there&mdash;it remained for the white men to
      search and see.
    </p>
    <p>
      For no very good reason Meyer had concluded that the gold must have been
      concealed in or about the cave, so here it was that they began their
      investigations.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, they bethought them of the well into which it might possibly have
      been thrown, but the fact of this matter proved very difficult to
      ascertain. Tying a piece of metal&mdash;it was an old Portuguese
      sword-hilt&mdash;to a string, they let it down and found that it touched
      water at a depth of one hundred and twenty feet, and bottom at a depth of
      one hundred and forty-seven feet. Therefore there were twenty-seven feet
      of water. Weighting a bucket they sank it until it rested upon this
      bottom, then wound it up again several times. On the third occasion it
      brought up a human bone and a wire anklet of pure gold. But this proved
      nothing, except that some ancient, perhaps thousands of years ago, had
      been thrown, or had fallen, into the well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still unsatisfied, Jacob Meyer, who was a most intrepid person, determined
      to investigate the place himself, a task of no little difficulty and
      danger, since proper ladders were wanting, nor, had they existed, was
      there anything to stand them on. Therefore it came to this: a seat must be
      rigged on to the end of the old copper chain, and be lowered into the pit
      after the fashion of the bucket. But, as Benita pointed out, although they
      might let him down, it was possible that they would not be able to draw
      him up again, in which case his plight must prove unfortunate. So, when
      the seat had been prepared, an experiment was made with a stone weighing
      approximately as much as a man. This Benita and her father let down easily
      enough, but, as they anticipated, when it came to winding it up again,
      their strength was barely sufficient to the task. Three people could do it
      well, but with two the thing was risky. Now Meyer asked&mdash;or, rather,
      commanded&mdash;the Molimo to order some of his men to help him, but this
      the old chief refused point blank to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, he made a number of excuses. They were all employed in drilling,
      and in watching for the Matabele; they were afraid to venture here, and so
      forth. At last Meyer grew furious; his eyes flashed, he ground his teeth,
      and began to threaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White man,&rdquo; said the Molimo, when he had done, &ldquo;it cannot be. I have
      fulfilled my bargain with you. Search for the gold; find it and take it
      away if you can. But this place is holy. None of my tribe, save he who
      holds the office of Molimo for the time, may set a foot therein. Kill me
      if you will&mdash;I care not; but so it is, and if you kill me, afterwards
      they will kill you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Meyer, seeing that nothing was to be gained by violence, changed his
      tone, and asked if he himself would help them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am old, my strength is small,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;yet I will put my hand to
      the chain and do my best. But, if I were you, I would not descend that
      pit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, I will descend it, and to-morrow,&rdquo; said Meyer.
    </p>

    <h3>
      THE BEGINNING OF THE SEARCH
    </h3>
    <p>
      Accordingly, on the next day the great experiment was made. The chain and
      ancient winding gear had been tested and proved to be amply sufficient to
      the strain. Therefore, nothing remained save for Meyer to place himself in
      the wooden seat with an oil-lamp, and in case this should be extinguished,
      matches and candles, of both of which they had a large supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did so boldly enough, and swung out over the mouth of the pit, while
      the three of them clutched the handles of the winch. Then they began to
      lower, and slowly his white face disappeared into the black depth. At
      every few turns his descent was stopped that he might examine the walls of
      the well, and when he was about fifty feet down he called to them to hold
      on, which they did, listening while he struck at the rock with a hammer,
      for here it sounded very hollow.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he shouted to them to lower away again, and they obeyed, until
      nearly all the chain was out, and they knew he must be near the water. Now
      Benita, peeping over the edge, saw that the star of light had vanished.
      His lamp was out, nor did he appear to attempt to re-light it. They
      shouted down the well to him, but no answer coming, began to wind up as
      fast as they were able. It was all that their united strength could
      manage, and very exhausted were they when at length Jacob reappeared at
      the top. At first, from the look of him they thought that he was dead, and
      had he not tied himself to the chain, dead he certainly would have been,
      for evidently his senses had left him long ago. Indeed, he had fallen
      almost out of the seat, over which his legs hung limply, his weight being
      supported by the hide rope beneath his arms which was made fast to the
      chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      They swung him in and dashed water over his face, till, to their relief,
      at last he began to gasp for breath, and revived sufficiently to enable
      them to half-lead and half-carry him out into the fresh air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened to you?&rdquo; asked Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poisoned with gases, I suppose,&rdquo; Meyer answered with a groan, for his
      head was aching sadly. &ldquo;The air is often bad at the bottom of deep wells,
      but I could smell or feel nothing until suddenly my senses left me. It was
      a near thing&mdash;a very near thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, when he had recovered a little, he told them that at one spot
      deep down in the well, on the river side of it, he found a place where it
      looked as though the rock had been cut away for a space of about six feet
      by four, and afterwards built up again with another sort of stone set in
      hard mortar or cement. Immediately beneath, too, were socket-holes in
      which the ends of beams still remained, suggesting that here had been a
      floor or platform. It was while he was examining these rotted beams that
      insensibility overcame him. He added that he thought that this might be
      the entrance to the place where the gold was hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so,&rdquo; said Mr. Clifford, &ldquo;hidden it must remain, since it can have no
      better guardian than bad air. Also, floors like that are common in all
      wells to prevent rubbish from falling into the water, and the stonework
      you saw probably was only put there by the ancients to mend a fault in the
      rock and prevent the wall from caving in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Meyer, &ldquo;since unless that atmosphere purifies a good
      deal I don&rsquo;t think that even I dare go down again, and until one gets
      there, of that it is difficult to be sure, though of course a lantern on a
      string will tell one something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the end of their first attempt. The search was not renewed until
      the following afternoon, when Meyer had recovered a little from the
      effects of the poisoning and the chafing of the hide ropes beneath his
      arms. Indeed, from the former he never did quite recover, since
      thenceforward Benita, who for her own reasons watched the man closely,
      discovered a marked and progressive change in his demeanour. Hitherto he
      had appeared to be a reserved man, one who kept tight hand upon himself,
      and, if she knew certain things about him, it was rather because she
      guessed, or deduced them, than because he allowed them to be seen. On two
      occasions only had he shown his heart before her&mdash;when they had
      spoken together by the shores of Lake Chrissie on the day of the arrival
      of the messengers, and he declared his ardent desire for wealth and power;
      and quite recently, when he killed the Matabele envoy. Yet she felt
      certain that this heart of his was very passionate and insurgent; that his
      calm was like the ice that hides the stream, beneath which its currents
      run fiercely, none can see whither. The fashion in which his dark eyes
      would flash, even when his pale countenance remained unmoved, told her so,
      as did other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, when he was recovering from his swoon, the first words that
      passed his lips were in German, of which she understood a little, and she
      thought that they shaped themselves to her name, coupled with endearing
      epithets. From that time forward he became less guarded&mdash;or, rather,
      it seemed as though he were gradually losing power to control himself. He
      would grow excited without apparent cause, and begin to declaim as to what
      he would do when he had found the gold; how he would pay the world back
      all it had caused him to suffer&mdash;how he would become a &ldquo;king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid that you will find that exalted position rather lonely,&rdquo; said
      Benita with a careless laugh, and next minute was sorry that she had
      spoken, for he answered, looking at her in a way that she did not like:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! There will be a queen&mdash;a beautiful queen, whom I shall endow
      with wealth, and deck with jewels, and surround with love and worship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fortunate lady!&rdquo; she said, still laughing, but taking the
      opportunity to go away upon some errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      At other times, especially after dark, he would walk up and down in front
      of the cave, muttering to himself, or singing wild old German songs in his
      rich voice. Also, he made a habit of ascending the granite pillar and
      seating himself there, and more than once called down to her to come up
      and share his &ldquo;throne.&rdquo; Still, these outbreaks were so occasional that her
      father, whose perceptions appeared to Benita to be less keen than
      formerly, scarcely noticed them, and for the rest his demeanour was what
      it had always been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further researches into the well being out of the question, their next
      step was to make a thorough inspection of the chapel-cave itself. They
      examined the walls inch by inch, tapping them with a hammer to hear if
      they sounded hollow, but without result. They examined the altar, but it
      proved to be a solid mass of rock. By the help of a little ladder they had
      made, they examined the crucifix, and discovered that the white figure on
      the cross had evidently been fashioned out of some heathen statue of soft
      limestone, for at its back were the remains of draperies, and long hair
      which the artist had not thought it necessary to cut away. Also, they
      found that the arms had been added, and were of a slightly different
      stone, and that the weight of the figure was taken partly by an iron
      staple which supported the body, and partly by strong copper wire twisted
      to resemble cord, and painted white, which was passed round the wrists and
      supported the arms. This wire ran through loops of rock cut in the
      traverse of the cross, that itself was only raised in relief by chiselling
      away the solid stone behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously enough, this part of the search was left to Mr. Clifford and
      Benita, since it was one that Jacob Meyer seemed reluctant to undertake. A
      Jew by birth, and a man who openly professed his want of belief in that or
      any other religion, he yet seemed to fear this symbol of the Christian
      faith, speaking of it as horrible and unlucky; yes, he who, without qualm
      or remorse, had robbed and desecrated the dead that lay about its feet.
      Well, the crucifix told them nothing; but as Mr. Clifford, lantern in
      hand, descended the ladder, which Benita held, Jacob Meyer, who was in
      front of the altar, called to them excitedly that he had found something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is more than we have,&rdquo; said Mr. Clifford, as he laid down the
      ladder and hurried to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meyer was sounding the floor with a staff of wood&mdash;an operation which
      he had only just began after the walls proved barren.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen now,&rdquo; he said, letting the heavy staff drop a few paces to the
      right of the altar, where it produced the hard, metallic clang that comes
      from solid stone when struck. Then he moved to the front of the altar and
      dropped it again, but now the note was hollow and reverberant. Again and
      again he repeated the experiment, till they had exactly mapped out where
      the solid rock ended and that which seemed to be hollow began&mdash;a
      space of about eight feet square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; he said triumphantly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the entrance to the place
      where the gold is,&rdquo; and the others were inclined to agree with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it remained to put their theory to the proof&mdash;a task of no small
      difficulty. Indeed, it took them three days of hard, continual work. It
      will be remembered that the floor of the cave was cemented over, and first
      of all this cement, which proved to be of excellent quality, being largely
      composed of powdered granite, must be broken up. By the help of a steel
      crowbar, which they had brought with them in the waggon, at length that
      part of their task was completed, revealing the rock beneath. By this time
      Benita was confident that, whatever might lie below, it was not the
      treasure, since it was evident that the poor, dying Portuguese would not
      have had the time or the strength to cement it over. When she told the
      others so, however, Meyer, convinced that he was on the right tack,
      answered that doubtless it was done by the Makalanga after the Portuguese
      days, as it was well known that they retained a knowledge of the building
      arts of their forefathers until quite a recent period, when the Matabele
      began to kill them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at length the cement was cleared away and the area swept, they
      discovered&mdash;for there ran the line of it&mdash;that here a great
      stone was set into the floor; it must have weighed several tons. As it was
      set in cement, however, to lift it, even if they had the strength to work
      the necessary levers, proved quite impossible. There remained only one
      thing to be done&mdash;to cut a way through. When they had worked at this
      task for several hours, and only succeeded in making a hole six inches
      deep, Mr. Clifford, whose old bones ached and whose hands were very sore,
      suggested that perhaps they might break it up with gunpowder. Accordingly,
      a pound flask of that explosive was poured into the hole, which they
      closed over with wet clay and a heavy rock, leaving a quill through which
      ran an extemporized fuse of cotton wick. All being prepared, their fuse
      was lit, and they left the cave and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes afterwards the dull sound of an explosion reached their ears,
      but more than an hour went by before the smoke and fumes would allow them
      to enter the place, and then it was to find that the results did not equal
      their expectations. To begin with, the slab was only cracked&mdash;not
      shattered, since the strength of the powder had been expended upwards, not
      downwards, as would have happened in the case of dynamite, of which they
      had none. Moreover, either the heavy stone which they had placed upon it,
      striking the roof of the cave, or the concussion of the air, had brought
      down many tons of rock, and caused wide and dangerous-looking cracks.
      Also, though she said nothing of it, it seemed to Benita that the great
      white statue on the cross was leaning a little further forward than it
      used to do. So the net result of the experiment was that they were obliged
      to drag away great fragments of the fallen roof that lay upon the stone,
      which remained almost as solid and obdurate as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there was nothing for it but to go on working with the crowbar. At
      length, towards the evening of the third day of their labour, when the two
      men were utterly tired out, a hole was broken through, demonstrating the
      fact that beneath this cover lay a hollow of some sort. Mr. Clifford, to
      say nothing of Benita, who was heartily weary of the business, wished to
      postpone proceedings till the morrow, but Jacob Meyer would not. So they
      toiled on until about eleven o&rsquo;clock at night, when at length the aperture
      was of sufficient size to admit a man. Now, as in the case of the well,
      they let down a stone tied to a string, to find that the place beneath was
      not more than eight feet deep. Then, to ascertain the condition of the
      air, a candle was lowered, which at first went out, but presently burnt
      well enough. This point settled, they brought their ladder, whereby Jacob
      descended with a lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another minute they heard the sound of guttural German oaths rising
      through the hole. Mr. Clifford asked what was the matter, and received the
      reply that the place was a tomb, with nothing in it but an accursed dead
      monk, information at which Benita could not help bursting into laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end of it was that both she and her father went down also, and there,
      sure enough, lay the remains of the old missionary in his cowl, with an
      ivory crucifix about his neck, and on his breast a scroll stating that he,
      Marco, born at Lisbon in 1438, had died at Bambatse in the year 1503,
      having laboured in the Empire of Monomotapa for seventeen years, and
      suffered great hardships and brought many souls to Christ. The scroll
      added that it was he, who before he entered into religion was a sculptor
      by trade, that had fashioned the figure on the cross in this chapel out of
      that of the heathen goddess which had stood in the same place from unknown
      antiquity. It ended with a request, addressed to all good Christians in
      Latin, that they who soon must be as he was would pray for his soul and
      not disturb his bones, which rested here in the hope of a blessed
      resurrection.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this pious wish was translated to Jacob Meyer by Mr. Clifford, who
      still retained some recollection of the classics which he had painfully
      acquired at Eton and Oxford, the Jew could scarcely contain his wrath.
      Indeed, looking at his bleeding hands, instead of praying for the soul of
      that excellent missionary, to reach whose remains he had laboured with
      such arduous, incessant toil, he cursed it wherever it might be, and
      unceremoniously swept the bones, which the document asked him not to
      disturb, into a corner of the tomb, in order to ascertain whether there
      was not, perhaps, some stair beneath them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Meyer,&rdquo; said Benita, who, in spite of the solemnity of the
      surroundings, could not control her sense of humour, &ldquo;if you are not
      careful the ghosts of all these people will haunt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them haunt me if they can,&rdquo; he answered furiously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
      in ghosts, and defy them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, looking up, Benita saw a figure gliding out of the
      darkness into the ring of light, so silently that she started, for it
      might well have been one of those ghosts in whom Jacob Meyer did not
      believe. In fact, however, it was the old Molimo, who had a habit of
      coming upon them thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What says the white man?&rdquo; he asked of Benita, while his dreamy eyes
      wandered over the three of them, and the hole in the violated tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says that he does not believe in spirits, and that he defies them,&rdquo;
       she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The white gold-seeker does not believe in spirits, and he defies them,&rdquo;
       Mambo repeated in his sing-song voice. &ldquo;He does not believe in the spirits
      that I see all around me now, the angry spirits of the dead, who speak
      together of where he shall lie and of what shall happen to him when he is
      dead, and of how they will welcome one who disturbs their rest and defies
      and curses them in his search for the riches which he loves. There is one
      standing by him now, dressed in a brown robe with a dead man cut in ivory
      like to that,&rdquo; and he pointed to the crucifix in Jacob&rsquo;s hands, &ldquo;and he
      holds the ivory man above him and threatens him with sleepless centuries
      of sorrow, when he is also one of those spirits in which he does not
      believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Meyer&rsquo;s rage blazed out. He turned upon the Molimo and reviled him in
      his own tongue, saying that he knew well where the treasure was hidden,
      and that if he did not point it out he would kill him and send him to his
      friends, the spirits. So savage and evil did he look that Benita retreated
      a little way, while Mr. Clifford strove in vain to calm him. But although
      Meyer laid his hand upon the knife in his belt and advanced upon him, the
      old Molimo neither budged an inch nor showed the slightest fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him rave on,&rdquo; he said, when at length Meyer paused exhausted. &ldquo;Just
      so in a time of storm the lightnings flash and the thunder peals, and the
      water foams down the face of rock; but then comes the sun again, and the
      hill is as it has ever been, only the storm is spent and lost. I am the
      rock, he is but the wind, the fire, and the rain. It is not permitted that
      he should hurt me, and those spirits in whom he does not believe treasure
      up his curses, to let them fall again like stones upon his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a contemptuous glance at Jacob, the old man turned and glided
      back into the darkness out of which he had appeared.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      BENITA PLANS ESCAPE
    </h3>
    <p>
      The next morning, while she was cooking breakfast, Benita saw Jacob Meyer
      seated upon a rock at a little distance, sullen and disconsolate. His chin
      was resting on his hand, and he watched her intently, never taking his
      eyes from her face. She felt that he was concentrating his will upon her;
      that some new idea concerning her had come into his mind; for it was one
      of her miseries that she possessed the power of interpreting the drift of
      this man&rsquo;s thoughts. Much as she detested him, there existed that curious
      link between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be remembered that, on the night when they first met at the crest
      of Leopard&rsquo;s Kloof, Jacob had called her a &ldquo;thought-sender,&rdquo; and some
      knowledge of their mental intimacy had come home to Benita. From that day
      forward her chief desire had been to shut a door between their natures, to
      isolate herself from him and him from her. Yet the attempt was never
      entirely successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fear and disgust took hold of her, bending there above the fire, all the
      while aware of the Jew&rsquo;s dark eyes that searched her through and through.
      Benita formed a sudden determination. She would implore her father to come
      away with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, such an attempt would be terribly dangerous. Of the Matabele
      nothing had been seen; but they might be about, and even if enough cattle
      could be collected to draw the waggon, it belonged to Meyer as much as to
      her father, and must therefore be left for him. Still, there remained the
      two horses, which the Molimo had told her were well and getting fat.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Meyer rose and began to speak to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking of, Miss Clifford?&rdquo; he asked in his soft foreign
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started, but answered readily enough:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the wood which is green, and the kid cutlets which are getting smoked.
      Are you not tired of kid, Mr. Meyer?&rdquo; she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved the question aside. &ldquo;You are so good&mdash;oh! I mean it&mdash;so
      really good that you should not tell stories even about small things. The
      wood is not green; I cut it myself from a dead tree; and the meat is not
      smoked; nor were you thinking of either. You were thinking of me, as I was
      thinking of you; but what exactly was in your mind, this time I do not
      know, and that is why I ask you to tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Meyer,&rdquo; she answered flushing; &ldquo;my mind is my own property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! do you say so? Now I hold otherwise&mdash;that it is my property, as
      mine is yours, a gift that Nature has given to each of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seek no such gift,&rdquo; she answered; but even then, much as she would have
      wished to do so, she could not utter a falsehood, and deny this horrible
      and secret intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for that, as I think it very precious; more precious even than
      the gold which we cannot find; for Miss Clifford, it brings me nearer
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned upon him, but he held up his hand, and went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do not be angry with me, and do not fear that I am going to trouble
      you with soft speeches, for I shall not, unless a time should come, as I
      think that perhaps it will, when you may wish to listen to them. But I
      want to point out something to you, Miss Clifford. Is it not a wonderful
      thing that our minds should be so in tune, and is there not an object in
      all this? Did I believe as you do, I should say that it was Heaven working
      in us&mdash;no: do not answer that the working comes from lower down. I
      take no credit for reading that upon your lips; the retort is too easy and
      obvious. I am content to say, however, that the work is that of instinct
      and nature, or, if you will, of fate, pointing out a road by which
      together we might travel to great ends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I travel my road alone, Mr. Meyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know, and that is the pity of it. The trouble between man and
      woman is that not in one case out of a million, even if they be lovers, do
      they understand each other. Their eyes may seek one another, their hands
      and lips may meet, and yet they remain distinct, apart, and often
      antagonistic. There is no communication of the soul. But when it chances
      to be hewn from the same rock as it were&mdash;oh! then what happiness may
      be theirs, and what opportunities!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly, Mr. Meyer; but, to be frank, the question does not interest
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet; but I am sure that one day it will. Meanwhile, I owe you an
      apology. I lost my temper before you last night. Well, do not judge me
      hardly, for I was utterly worn out, and that old idiot vexed me with his
      talk about ghosts, in which I do not believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did it make you so angry? Surely you could have afforded to
      treat it with contempt, instead of doing&mdash;as you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word! I don&rsquo;t know, but I suppose most of us are afraid lest we
      should be forced to accept that which we refuse. This ancient place gets
      upon the nerves, Miss Clifford; yours as well as mine. I can afford to be
      open about it, because I know that you know. Think of its associations:
      all the crime that has been committed here for ages and ages, all the
      suffering that has been endured here. Doubtless human sacrifices were
      offered in this cave or outside of it; that great burnt ring in the rock
      there may have been where they built the fires. And then those Portuguese
      starving to death, slowly starving to death while thousands of savages
      watched them die. Have you ever thought what it means? But of course you
      have, for like myself you are cursed with imagination. God in heaven! is
      it wonderful that it gets upon the nerves? especially when one cannot find
      what one is looking for, that vast treasure&rdquo;&mdash;and his face became
      ecstatic&mdash;&ldquo;that shall yet be yours and mine, and make us great and
      happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But which at present only makes me a scullery-maid and most unhappy,&rdquo;
       replied Benita cheerfully, for she heard her father&rsquo;s footstep. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      talk any more of the treasure, Mr. Meyer, or we shall quarrel. We have
      enough of that during business hours, when we are hunting for it, you
      know. Give me the dish, will you? This meat is cooked at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Benita could not be rid of that treasure, since after breakfast the
      endless, unprofitable search began again. Once more the cave was sounded,
      and other hollow places were discovered upon which the two men got to
      work. With infinite labour three of them were broken into in as many days,
      and like the first, found to be graves, only this time of ancients who,
      perhaps, had died before Christ was born. There they lay upon their sides,
      their bones burnt by the hot cement that had been poured over them, their
      gold-headed and gold-ferruled rods of office in their hands, their
      gold-covered pillows of wood, such as the Egyptians used, beneath their
      skulls, gold bracelets upon their arms and ankles, cakes of gold beneath
      them which had fallen from the rotted pouches that once hung about their
      waists, vases of fine glazed pottery that had been filled with offerings,
      or in some cases with gold dust to pay the expenses of their journey in
      the other world, standing round them, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In their way these discoveries were rich enough&mdash;from one tomb alone
      they took over a hundred and thirty ounces of gold&mdash;to say nothing of
      their surpassing archæological interest. Still they were not what they
      sought: all that gathered wealth of Monomotapa which the fleeing
      Portuguese had brought with them and buried in this, their last
      stronghold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benita ceased to take the slightest interest in the matter; she would not
      even be at the pains to go to look at the third skeleton, although it was
      that of a man who had been almost a giant, and, to judge from the amount
      of bullion which he took to the tomb with him, a person of great
      importance in his day. She felt as though she wished never to see another
      human bone or ancient bead or bangle; the sight of a street in Bayswater
      in a London fog&mdash;yes, or a toy-shop window in Westbourne Grove&mdash;would
      have pleased her a hundred times better than these unique remains that,
      had they known of them in those days, would have sent half the learned
      societies of Europe crazy with delight. She wished to escape from
      Bambatse, its wondrous fortifications, its mysterious cone, its cave, its
      dead, and&mdash;from Jacob Meyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benita stood upon the top of her prison wall and looked with longing at
      the wide, open lands below. She even dared to climb the stairs which ran
      up the mighty cone of granite, and seated herself in the cup-like
      depression on its crest, whence Jacob Meyer had called to her to come and
      share his throne. It was a dizzy place, for the pillar leaning outwards,
      its point stood almost clear of the water-scarped rock, so that beneath
      her was a sheer drop of about four hundred feet to the Zambesi bed. At
      first the great height made her feel faint. Her eyes swam, and unpleasant
      tremors crept along her spine, so that she was glad to sink to the floor,
      whence she knew she could not fall. By degrees, however, she recovered her
      nerve, and was able to study the glorious view of stream and marshes and
      hills beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      For she had come here with a purpose, to see whether it would not be
      possible to escape down the river in a canoe, or in native boats such as
      the Makalanga owned and used for fishing, or to cross from bank to bank.
      Apparently it was impossible, for although the river beneath and above
      them was still enough, about a mile below began a cataract that stretched
      as far as she could see, and was bordered on either side by rocky hills
      covered with forest, over which, even if they could obtain porters, a
      canoe could not be carried. This, indeed, she had already heard from the
      Molimo, but knowing his timid nature, she wished to judge of the matter
      for herself. It came to this then: if they were to go, it must be on the
      horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Descending the cone Benita went to find her father, to whom as yet she had
      said nothing of her plans. The opportunity was good, for she knew that he
      would be alone. As it chanced, on that afternoon Meyer had gone down the
      hill in order to try to persuade the Makalanga to give them ten or twenty
      men to help them in their excavations. In this, it will be remembered, he
      had already failed so far as the Molimo was concerned, but he was not a
      man easily turned from his purpose, and he thought that if he could see
      Tamas and some of the other captains he might be able by bribery, threats,
      or otherwise, to induce them to forget their superstitious fears, and help
      in the search. As a matter of fact, he was utterly unsuccessful, since one
      and all they declared that for them to enter that sacred place would mean
      their deaths, and that the vengeance of Heaven would fall upon their tribe
      and destroy it root and branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford, on whom all this heavy labour had begun to tell, was taking
      advantage of the absence of his taskmaster, Jacob, to sleep awhile in the
      hut which they had now built for themselves beneath the shadow of the
      baobab-tree. As she reached it he came out yawning, and asked her where
      she had been. Benita told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A giddy place,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have never ventured to try it myself. What
      did you go up there for, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To look at the river while Mr. Meyer was away, father; for if he had seen
      me do so he would have guessed my reason; indeed, I dare say that he will
      guess it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What reason, Benita?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see whether it would not be possible to escape down it in a boat. But
      there is no chance. It is all rapids below, with hills and rocks and trees
      on either bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What need have you to escape at present?&rdquo; he asked eyeing her curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every need,&rdquo; she answered with passion. &ldquo;I hate this place; it is a
      prison, and I loathe the very name of treasure. Also,&rdquo; and she paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also what, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also,&rdquo; and her voice sank to a whisper, as though she feared that he
      should overhear her even at the bottom of the hill; &ldquo;also, I am afraid of
      Mr. Meyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This confession did not seem to surprise her father, who merely nodded his
      head and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I think that he is going mad, and it is not pleasant for us to be
      cooped up here alone with a madman, especially when he has begun to speak
      to me as he does now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that he has been impertinent to you,&rdquo; said the old man,
      flushing up, &ldquo;for if so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not impertinent&mdash;as yet,&rdquo; and she told him what had passed
      between Meyer and herself, adding, &ldquo;You see, father, I detest this man;
      indeed, I want to have nothing to do with any man; for me all that is over
      and done with,&rdquo; and she gave a dry little sob which appeared to come from
      her very heart. &ldquo;And yet, he seems to be getting some kind of power over
      me. He follows me about with his eyes, prying into my mind, and I feel
      that he is beginning to be able to read it. I can bear no more. Father,
      father, for God&rsquo;s sake, take me away from this hateful hill and its gold
      and its dead, and let us get out into the veld again together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be glad enough, dearest,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have had plenty of
      this wildgoose chase, which I was so mad as to be led into by the love of
      wealth. Indeed, I am beginning to believe that if it goes on much longer I
      shall leave my bones here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if such a dreadful thing as that were to happen, what would become of
      me, alone with Jacob Meyer?&rdquo; she asked quietly. &ldquo;I might even be driven to
      the same fate as that poor girl two hundred years ago,&rdquo; and she pointed to
      the cone of rock behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t talk like that!&rdquo; he broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? One must face things, and it would be better than Jacob Meyer;
      for who would protect me here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford walked up and down for a few minutes, while his daughter
      watched him anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see no plan,&rdquo; he said, stopping opposite her. &ldquo;We cannot take the
      waggon even if there are enough oxen left to draw it, for it is his as
      much as mine, and I am sure that he will never leave this treasure unless
      he is driven away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am sure I hope that he will not. But, father, the horses are our
      own; it was his that died, you remember. We can ride away on them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we could ride away to our deaths. Suppose they got sick or lame;
      suppose we meet the Matabele, or could find no game to shoot; suppose one
      of us fell ill&mdash;oh! and a hundred things. What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then it is just as well to perish in the wilderness as here, where
      our risks are almost as great. We must take our chance, and trust to God.
      Perhaps He will be merciful and help us. Listen now, father. To-morrow is
      Sunday, when you and I do no work that we can help. Mr. Meyer is a Jew,
      and he won&rsquo;t waste Sunday. Well now, I will say that I want to go down to
      the outer wall to fetch some clothes which I left in the waggon, and to
      take others for the native women to wash, and of course you will come with
      me. Perhaps he will be deceived, and stay behind, especially as he has
      been there to-day. Then we can get the horses and guns and ammunition, and
      anything else that we can carry in the way of food, and persuade the old
      Molimo to open the gate for us. You know, the little side gate that cannot
      be seen from up here, and before Mr. Meyer misses us and comes to look, we
      shall be twenty miles away, and&mdash;horses can&rsquo;t be overtaken by a man
      on foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will say that we have deserted him, and that will be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can leave a letter with the Molimo explaining that it was my fault,
      that I was getting ill and thought that I should die, and that you knew it
      would not be fair to ask him to come, and so to lose the treasure, to
      every halfpenny of which he is welcome when it is found. Oh! father, don&rsquo;t
      hesitate any longer; say that you will take me away from Mr. Meyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it then,&rdquo; answered Mr. Clifford, and as he spoke, hearing a sound,
      they looked up and saw Jacob approaching them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily he was so occupied with his own thoughts that he never noted the
      guilty air upon their faces, and they had time to compose themselves a
      little. But even thus his suspicions were aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you talking of so earnestly?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were wondering how you were getting on with the Makalanga,&rdquo; answered
      Benita, fibbing boldly, &ldquo;and whether you would persuade them to face the
      ghosts. Did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; he answered with a scowl. &ldquo;Those ghosts are our worst enemies in
      this place; the cowards swore that they would rather die. I should have
      liked to take some of them at their word and make ghosts of them; but I
      remembered the situation and didn&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Miss Clifford, I
      never even lost my temper, outwardly at any rate. Well, there it is; if
      they won&rsquo;t help us, we must work the harder. I&rsquo;ve got a new plan, and
      we&rsquo;ll begin on it to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-morrow, Mr. Meyer,&rdquo; replied Benita with a smile. &ldquo;It is Sunday,
      and we rest on Sunday, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I forgot. The Makalanga with their ghosts and you with your Sunday&mdash;really
      I do not know which is the worse. Well, then, I must do my own share and
      yours too, I suppose,&rdquo; and he turned with a shrug of his shoulders.

    <h3>
      THE FLIGHT
    </h3>
    <p>
      The next morning, Sunday, Meyer went to work on his new plan. What it was
      Benita did not trouble to inquire, but she gathered that it had something
      to do with the measuring out of the chapel cave into squares for the more
      systematic investigation of each area. At twelve o&rsquo;clock he emerged for
      his midday meal, in the course of which he remarked that it was very
      dreary working in that place alone, and that he would be glad when it was
      Monday, and they could accompany him. His words evidently disturbed Mr.
      Clifford not a little, and even excited some compunction in the breast of
      Benita.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would his feelings be, she wondered, when he found that they had run
      away, leaving him to deal with their joint undertaking single-handed!
      Almost was she minded to tell him the whole truth; yet&mdash;and this was
      a curious evidence of the man&rsquo;s ascendancy over her&mdash;she did not.
      Perhaps she felt that to do so would be to put an end to their scheme,
      since then by argument, blandishments, threats, force, or appeal to their
      sense of loyalty, it mattered not which, he would bring about its
      abandonment. But she wanted to fulfil that scheme, to be free of Bambatse,
      its immemorial ruins, its graveyard cave, and the ghoul, Jacob Meyer, who
      could delve among dead bones and in living hearts with equal skill and
      insight, and yet was unable to find the treasure that lay beneath either
      of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they hid the truth, and talked with feverish activity about other
      things, such as the drilling of the Makalanga, and the chances of an
      attack by the Matabele, which happily now seemed to be growing small; also
      of the conditions of their cattle, and the prospect of obtaining more to
      replace those that had died. Indeed, Benita went farther; in her new-found
      zeal of deception she proceeded to act a lie, yes, even with her father&rsquo;s
      reproachful eyes fixed upon her. Incidentally she mentioned that they were
      going to have an outing, to climb down the ladder and visit the Makalanga
      camp between the first and second walls and mix with the great world for a
      few hours; also to carry their washing to be done there, and bring up some
      clean clothes and certain books which she had left below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob came out of his thoughts and calculations, and listened gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have half a mind to come with you,&rdquo; he said, words at which Benita
      shivered. &ldquo;It certainly is most cursed lonesome in that cave, and I seem
      to hear things in it, as though those old bones were rattling, sounds like
      sighs and whispers too, which are made by the draught.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Benita.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bold stroke, but it succeeded. If he had any doubts they
      vanished, and he answered at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have not the time. We have to get this business finished one
      way or another before the wet season comes on, and we are drowned out of
      the place with rain, or rotted by fever. Take your afternoon out, Miss
      Clifford; every maid of all work is entitled to as much, and I am afraid
      that is your billet here. Only,&rdquo; he added, with that care for her safety
      which he always showed in his more temperate moods, &ldquo;pray be careful,
      Clifford, to get back before sundown. That wall is too risky for your
      daughter to climb in the dusk. Call me from the foot of it; you have the
      whistle, and I will come down to help her up. I think I&rsquo;ll go with you
      after all. No, I won&rsquo;t. I made myself so unpleasant to them yesterday that
      those Makalanga can&rsquo;t wish to see any more of me at present. I hope you
      will have a more agreeable afternoon than I shall. Why don&rsquo;t you take a
      ride outside the wall? Your horses are fat and want exercise, and I do not
      think that you need be afraid of the Matabele.&rdquo; Then without waiting for
      an answer, he rose and left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford looked after him doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know,&rdquo; said Benita, &ldquo;it seems horribly mean, but one must do shabby
      things sometimes. Here are the bundles all ready, so let us be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly they went, and from the top of the wall Benita glanced back to
      bid goodbye to that place which she hoped never to see again. Yet she
      could not feel as though she looked her last upon it; to her it wore no
      air of farewell, and even as she descended the perilous stairs, she found
      herself making mental notes as to how they might best be climbed again.
      Also, she could not believe that she had done with Mr. Meyer. It seemed to
      her as though for a long while yet her future would be full of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the outer fortifications in safety, and there were greeted
      with some surprise but with no displeasure by the Makalanga, whom they
      found still drilling with the rifles, in the use of which a certain number
      of them appeared to have become fairly proficient. Going to the hut in
      which the spare goods from the waggon had been stored, they quickly made
      their preparations. Here also, Mr. Clifford wrote a letter, one of the
      most unpleasant that he had ever been called upon to compose. It ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Meyer,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you will think of us, but we are escaping from this
      place. The truth is that I am not well, and my daughter can bear it no
      longer. She says that if she stops here, she will die, and that hunting
      for treasure in that ghastly grave-yard is shattering her nerves. I should
      have liked to tell you, but she begged me not, being convinced that if I
      did, you would over-persuade us or stop us in some way. As for the gold,
      if you can find it, take it all. I renounce my share. We are leaving you
      the waggon and the oxen, and starting down country on our horses. It is a
      perilous business, but less so than staying here, under the circumstances.
      If we never meet again we hope that you will forgive us, and wish you all
      good fortune.&mdash;Yours sincerely and with much regret,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T. Clifford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter written, they saddled the horses which had been brought up for
      their inspection, and were found to be in good case, and fastened their
      scanty belongings, and as many cartridges as they could carry in packs
      behind their saddles. Then, each of them armed with a rifle&mdash;for
      during their long journeyings Benita had learned to shoot&mdash;they
      mounted and made for the little side-entrance, as the main gate through
      which they had passed on their arrival was now built up. This
      side-entrance, a mere slit in the great wall, with a precipitous approach,
      was open, for now that their fear of the Matabele had to some extent
      passed off, the Makalanga used it to drive their sheep and goats in and
      out, since it was so constructed with several twists and turns in the
      thickness of the wall, that in a few minutes it could be effectually
      blocked by stones that lay at hand. Also, the ancient architect had
      arranged it in such a fashion that it was entirely commanded from the
      crest of the wall on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Makalanga, who had been watching their proceedings curiously, made no
      attempt to stop them, although they guessed that they might have a little
      trouble with the sentries who guarded the entrances all day, and even when
      it was closed at night, with whom also Mr. Clifford proposed to leave the
      letter. When they reached the place, however, and had dismounted to lead
      the horses down the winding passage and the steep ascent upon its further
      side, it was to find that the only guard visible proved to be the old
      Molimo himself, who sat there, apparently half asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as they came he showed himself to be very much awake, for without
      moving he asked them at once whither they were going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To take a ride,&rdquo; answered Mr. Clifford. &ldquo;The lady, my daughter, is weary
      of being cooped up in this fortress, and wishes to breathe the air
      without. Let us pass, friend, or we shall not be back by sunset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you be coming back at sunset, white man, why do you carry so many
      things upon your packs, and why are your saddle-bags filled with
      cartridges?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Surely you do not speak the truth to me, and you
      hope that never more will you see the sun set upon Bambatse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now understanding that it was hopeless to deceive him, Benita exclaimed
      boldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so; but oh! my Father, stay us not, for fear is behind us, and
      therefore we fly hence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is there no fear before you, maiden? Fear of the wilderness, where
      none wander save perchance the Amandabele with their bloody spears; fear
      of wild beasts and of sickness that may overtake you so that, first one
      and then the other, you perish there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is plenty, my Father, but none of them so bad as the fear behind.
      Yonder place is haunted, and we give up our search and would dwell there
      no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is haunted truly, maiden, but its spirits will not harm you whom they
      welcome as one appointed, and we are ever ready to protect you because of
      their command that has come to me in dreams. Nor, indeed, is it the
      spirits whom you fear, but rather the white man, your companion, who would
      bend you to his will. Deny it not, for I have seen it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then knowing the truth, surely you will let us go,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;for I
      swear to you that I dare not stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who am I that I should forbid you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Yet I tell you that you
      would do well to stay and save yourselves much terror. Maiden, have I not
      said it days and day ago, that here and here only you must accomplish your
      fate? Go now if you will, but you shall return again,&rdquo; and once more he
      seemed to begin to doze in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two of them consulted hastily together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no use turning back now,&rdquo; said Benita, who was almost weeping with
      doubt and vexation. &ldquo;I will not be frightened by his vague talk. What can
      he know of the future more than any of the rest of us? Besides, all he
      says is that we shall come back again, and if that does happen, at least
      we shall have been free for a little while. Come, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; answered Mr. Clifford, who seemed too miserable and
      depressed to argue. Only he threw down the letter upon the Molimo&rsquo;s lap,
      and begged him to give it to Meyer when he came to look for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man took no notice; no, not even when Benita bade him farewell and
      thanked him for his kindness, praying that all good fortune might attend
      him and his tribe, did he answer a single word or even look up. So they
      led their horses down the narrow passage where there was scarcely room for
      them to pass, and up the steep path beyond. On the further side of the
      ancient ditch they remounted them while the Makalanga watched them from
      the walls, and cantered away along the same road by which they had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this road, or rather track, ran first through the gardens and then
      among the countless ruined houses that in bygone ages formed the great
      city whereof the mount Bambatse had been the citadel and sanctuary. The
      relics of a lost civilization extended for several miles, and were bounded
      by a steep and narrow neck or pass in the encircling hills, the same that
      Robert Seymour and his brother had found too difficult for their waggon at
      the season in which they visited the place some years before. This pass,
      or port as it is called in South Africa, had been strongly fortified, for
      on either side of it were the ruins of towers. Moreover, at its crest it
      was so narrow and steep-sided that a few men posted there, even if they
      were armed only with bows and arrows, could hold an attacking force in
      check for a considerable time. Beyond it, after the hill was descended, a
      bush-clad plain dotted with kopjes and isolated granite pillars formed of
      boulders piled one upon another, rolled away for many miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford and Benita had started upon their mad journey about three
      o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and when the sun began to set they found
      themselves upon this plain fifteen or sixteen miles from Bambatse, of
      which they had long lost sight, for it lay beyond the intervening hills.
      Near to them was a kopje, where they had outspanned by a spring of water
      when on their recent journey, and since they did not dare to travel in the
      dark, here they determined to off-saddle, for round this spring was good
      grass for the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it chanced, they came upon some hartebeeste here which were trekking
      down to drink, but although they would have been glad of meat, they were
      afraid to shoot, fearing lest they should attract attention; nor for the
      same reason did they like to light a fire. So having knee-haltered the
      horses in such fashion that they could not wander far, and turned them
      loose to feed, they sat down under a tree, and made some sort of a meal
      off the biltong and cooked corn which they had brought with them. By the
      time this was finished darkness fell, for there was little moon, so that
      nothing remained to do except to sleep within a circle of a few dead
      thorn-boughs which they had drawn about their camp. This, then, they did,
      and so weary were they both, that notwithstanding all the emotions through
      which they had passed, and their fears lest lions should attack them&mdash;for
      of these brutes there were many in this veld&mdash;rested soundly and
      undisturbed till within half an hour of dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising somewhat chilled, for though the air was warm a heavy dew had
      soaked their blankets, once more they ate and drank by starlight, while
      the horses, which they had tied up close to them during the night, filled
      themselves with grass. At the first break of day they saddled them, and
      before the sun rose were on their road again. At length up it came, and
      the sight and warmth of it put new heart into Benita. Her fears seemed to
      depart with the night, and she said to her father that this successful
      start was of good augury, to which he only answered that he hoped so.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that day they rode forward in beautiful weather, not pressing their
      horses, for now they were sure that Jacob Meyer, who if he followed at all
      must do so on foot, would never be able to overtake them. At noon they
      halted, and having shot a small buck, Benita cooked some of it in the one
      pot that they had brought with them, and they ate a good meal of fresh
      meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riding on again, towards sundown they came to another of their old
      camping-places, also a bush-covered kopje. Here the spring of water was
      more than halfway up the hill, so there they off-saddled in a green bower
      of a place that because of its ferns and mosses looked like a rock garden.
      Now, although they had enough cold meat for food, they thought themselves
      quite safe in lighting a fire. Indeed, this it seemed necessary to do,
      since they had struck the fresh spoor of lions, and even caught sight of
      one galloping away in the tall reeds on the marshy land at the foot of the
      hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening they fared sumptuously upon venison, and as on the previous
      day lay down to rest in a little &ldquo;boma&rdquo; or fence made of boughs. But they
      were not allowed to sleep well this night, for scarcely had they shut
      their eyes when a hyena began to howl about them. They shouted and the
      brute went away, but an hour or two later, they heard ominous grunting
      sounds, followed presently by a loud roar, which was answered by another
      roar, whereat the horses began to whinny in a frightened fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lions!&rdquo; said Mr. Clifford, jumping up and throwing dead wood on the fire
      till it burnt to a bright blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that all sleep became impossible, for although the lions did not
      attack them, having once winded the horses they would not go away, but
      continued wandering round the kopje, grunting and growling. This went on
      till abut three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, when at last the beasts took their
      departure, for they heard them roaring in the distance. Now that they
      seemed safe, having first made up the fire, they tried to get some rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, as it appeared to her, Benita had been asleep but a little while,
      she was awakened by a new noise. It was still dark, but the starlight
      showed her that the horses were quite quiet; indeed, one of them was lying
      down, and the other eating some green leaves from the branches of the tree
      to which it was tethered. Therefore that noise had not come from any wild
      animal of which they were afraid. She listened intently, and presently
      heard it again; it was a murmur like to that of people talking somewhere
      at the bottom of the hill. Then she woke her father and told him, but
      although once or twice they thought they heard the sound of footsteps,
      nothing else could be distinguished. Still they rose, and having saddled
      and bridled the horses as noiselessly as might be, waited for the dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last it came. Up on the side of the kopje they were in clear air, above
      which shone the red lights of morning, but under them lay billows of
      dense, pearl-hued mist. By degrees this thinned beneath the rays of the
      risen sun, and through it, looking gigantic in that light, Benita saw a
      savage wrapped in a kaross, who was walking up and down and yawning, a
      great spear in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;look!&rdquo; and Mr. Clifford stared down the line of
      her outstretched finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Matabele,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My God! the Matabele!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE CHASE
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Matabele it was, sure enough; there could be no doubt of it, for soon
      three other men joined the sentry and began to talk with him, pointing
      with their great spears at the side of the hill. Evidently they were
      arranging a surprise when there was sufficient light to carry it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have seen our fire,&rdquo; whispered her father to Benita; &ldquo;now, if we
      wish to save our lives, there is only one thing to do&mdash;ride for it
      before they muster. The impi will be camped upon the other side of the
      hill, so we must take the road we came by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That runs back to Bambatse,&rdquo; faltered Benita.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bambatse is better than the grave,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;Pray Heaven that we
      may get there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this argument there was no answer, so having drunk a sup of water, and
      swallowing a few mouthfuls of food as they went, they crept to the horses,
      mounted them, and as silently as possible began to ride down the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentry was alone again, the other three men having departed. He stood
      with his back towards them. Presently when they were quite close on to
      him, he heard their horses&rsquo; hoofs upon the grass, wheeled round at the
      sound, and saw them. Then with a great shout he lifted his spear and
      charged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford, who was leading, held out his rifle at arm&rsquo;s length&mdash;to
      raise it to his shoulder he had no time&mdash;and pulled the trigger.
      Benita heard the bullet clap upon the hide shield, and next instant saw
      the Matabele warrior lying on his back, beating the air with his hands and
      feet. Also, she saw beyond the shoulder of the kopje, which they were
      rounding, hundreds of men marching, and behind them a herd of cattle, the
      dim light gleaming upon the stabbing spears and on the horns of the oxen.
      She glanced to the right, and there were more men. The two wings of the
      impi were closing upon them. Only a little lane was left in the middle.
      They must get through before it shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she gasped, striking the horse with her heel and the butt of her
      gun, and jerking at its mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father saw also, and did likewise, so that the beasts broke into a
      gallop. Now from the point of each wing sprang out thin lines of men,
      looking like great horns, or nippers, whose business it was to meet and
      cut them off. Could they pass between them before they did meet? That was
      the question, and upon its answer it depended whether or no they had
      another three minutes to live. To think of mercy at the hands of these
      bloodthirsty brutes, after they had just killed one of their number before
      their eyes, was absurd. It was true he had been shot in self-defence; but
      what count would savages take of that, or of the fact that they were but
      harmless travellers? White people were not very popular with the Matabele
      just then, as they knew well; also, their murder in this remote place,
      with not another of their race within a couple of hundred miles, would
      never even be reported, and much less avenged. It was as safe as any crime
      could possibly be.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this passed through their minds as they galloped towards those closing
      points. Oh! the horror of it! But two hundred yards to cover, and their
      fate would be decided. Either they would have escaped at least for a
      while, or time would be done with them; or, a third alternative, they
      might be taken prisoners, in all probability a yet more dreadful doom.
      Even then Benita determined that if she could help it this should not
      befall her. She had the rifle and the revolver that Jacob Meyer had given
      her. Surely she would be able to find a moment to use one or the other
      upon herself. She clenched her teeth, and struck the horse again and
      again, so that now they flew along. The Matabele soldiers were running
      their best to catch them, and if these had been given but five seconds of
      start, caught they must have been. But that short five seconds saved their
      lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they rushed through them the foremost men of the nippers were not
      more than twenty yards apart. Seeing that they had passed, these halted
      and hurled a shower of spears after them. One flashed by Benita&rsquo;s cheek, a
      line of light; she felt the wind of it. Another cut her dress, and a third
      struck her father&rsquo;s horse in the near hind leg just above the knee-joint,
      remaining fast there for a stride or two, and then falling to the ground.
      At first the beast did not seem to be incommoded by this wound; indeed, it
      only caused it to gallop quicker, and Benita rejoiced, thinking that it
      was but a scratch. Then she forgot about it, for some of the Matabele, who
      had guns, began to shoot them, and although their marksmanship was vile,
      one or two of the bullets went nearer than was pleasant. Lastly a man, the
      swiftest runner of them all, shouted after them in Zulu:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horse is wounded. We will catch you both before the sun sets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they passed over the crest of a rise and lost sight of them for a
      while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; gasped Benita when they were alone again in the silent veld;
      but Mr. Clifford shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think they will follow us?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard what the fellow said,&rdquo; he answered evasively. &ldquo;Doubtless they
      are on their way to attack Bambatse, and have been round to destroy some
      other wretched tribe, and steal the cattle which we saw. Yes, I fear that
      they will follow. The question is, which of us can get to Bambatse first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely we ought to on the horses, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if nothing happens to them,&rdquo; and as he spoke the words the mare
      which he was riding dropped sharply upon her hind leg, the same that had
      been struck with the spear; then recovered herself and galloped on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see that?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded; then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we get off and look at the cut?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Our only chance is to keep her moving; if
      once the wound stiffens, there&rsquo;s an end. The sinew cannot have been
      severed, or it would have come before now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they pushed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that morning did they canter forward wherever the ground was smooth
      enough to allow them to do so, and notwithstanding the increasing lameness
      of Mr. Clifford&rsquo;s mare, made such good progress that by midday they
      reached the place where they had passed the first night after leaving
      Bambatse. Here sheer fatigue and want of water forced them to stop a
      little while. They dismounted and drank greedily from the spring, after
      which they allowed the horses to drink also; indeed it was impossible to
      keep them away from the water. Then they ate a little, not because they
      desired food, but to keep up their strength, and while they did so
      examined the mare. By now her hind leg was much swollen, and blood still
      ran from the gash made by the assegai. Moreover, the limb was drawn up so
      that the point of the hoof only rested on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must get on before it sets fast,&rdquo; said Mr. Clifford, and they mounted
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great heavens! what was this? The mare would not stir. In his despair Mr.
      Clifford beat it cruelly, whereupon the poor brute hobbled forward a few
      paces on three legs, and again came to a standstill. Either an injured
      sinew had given or the inflammation was now so intense that it could not
      bend its knee. Understanding what this meant to them, Benita&rsquo;s nerve gave
      out at last, and she burst into weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, love,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;God&rsquo;s will be done. Perhaps they have given
      up the hunt by now; at any rate, my legs are left, and Bambatse is not
      more than sixteen miles away. Forward now,&rdquo; and holding to her
      saddle-strap they went up the long, long slope which led to the poort in
      the hills around Bambatse.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would have liked to shoot the mare, but being afraid to fire a rifle,
      could not do so. So they left the unhappy beast to its fate, and with it
      everything it carried, except a few of the cartridges. Before they went,
      however, at Benita&rsquo;s prayer, her father devoted a few seconds to
      unbuckling the girths and pulling off the bridle, so that it might have a
      chance of life. For a little way it hobbled after them on three legs,
      then, the saddle still upon its back, stood whinnying piteously, till at
      last, to Benita&rsquo;s intense relief, a turn in their path hid it from their
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a mile further on she looked round in the faint hope that it might
      have recovered itself and followed. But no mare was to be seen. Something
      else was to be seen, however, for there, three or four miles away upon the
      plain behind them, easy to be distinguished in that dazzling air, were a
      number of black spots that occasionally seemed to sparkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; she asked faintly, as one who feared the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Matabele who follow us,&rdquo; answered her father, &ldquo;or rather a company of
      their swiftest runners. It is their spears that glitter so. Now, my love,
      this is the position,&rdquo; he went on, as they struggled forward: &ldquo;those men
      will catch us before ever we can get to Bambatse; they are trained to run
      like that, for fifty miles, if need be. But with this start they cannot
      catch your horse, you must go on and leave me to look after myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you shall, and you must. I am your father and I order you. As for me,
      what does it matter? I may hide from them and escape, or&mdash;at least I
      am old, my life is done, whereas yours is before you. Now, good-bye, and
      go on,&rdquo; and he let go of the saddle-strap.
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of answer Benita pulled up the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one yard,&rdquo; she said, setting her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he began to storm at her, calling her disobedient, and undutiful, and
      when this means failed to move her, to implore her almost with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, dear,&rdquo; she said, leaning down towards him as he walked, for now
      they were going on again, &ldquo;I told you why I wanted to run away from
      Bambatse, didn&rsquo;t I?&mdash;because I would rather risk my life than stay.
      Well, do you think that I wish to return there and live in that place
      alone with Jacob Meyer? Also, I will tell you another thing. You remember
      about Mr. Seymour? Well, I can&rsquo;t get over that; I can&rsquo;t get over it at
      all, and therefore, although of course I am afraid, it is all one to me.
      No, we will escape together, or die together; the first if we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then with a groan he gave up the argument, and as he found breath they
      discussed their chances. Their first idea was to hide, but save for a few
      trees all the country was open; there was no place to cover them. They
      thought of the banks of the Zambesi, but between them and the river rose a
      bare, rock-strewn hill with several miles of slope. Long before they could
      reach its crest, even if a horse were able to travel there, they must be
      overtaken. In short, there was nothing to do except to push for the nek,
      and if they were fortunate enough to reach it before the Matabele, to
      abandon the horse there and try to conceal themselves among the ruins of
      the houses beyond. This, perhaps, they might do when once the sun was
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they did not deceive themselves; the chances were at least fifty to
      one against them, unless indeed their pursuers grew weary and let them go.
    </p>
    <p>
      At present, however, they were by no means weary, for having perceived
      them from far away, the long-legged runners put on the pace, and the
      distance between them and their quarry was lessening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Benita, &ldquo;please understand one thing. I do not mean to be
      taken alive by those savages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! how can I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask you,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I will see to that myself. Only, if I
      should make any mistake&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and she looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man was getting very tired. He panted up the steep hillside, and
      stumbled against the stones. Benita noted it, and slipping from the horse,
      made him mount while she ran alongside. Then when he was a little rested
      they changed places again, and so covered several miles of country.
      Subsequently, when both of them were nearly exhausted, they tried riding
      together&mdash;she in front and he behind, for their baggage had long
      since been thrown away. But the weary beast could not carry this double
      burden, and after a few hundred yards of it, stumbled, fell, struggled to
      its feet again, and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      So once more they were obliged to ride and walk alternately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there was not much more than an hour of daylight left, and the narrow
      pass lay about three miles ahead of them. That dreadful three miles; ever
      thereafter it was Benita&rsquo;s favourite nightmare! At the beginning of it the
      leading Matabele were about two thousand yards behind them; half-way,
      about a thousand; and at the commencement of the last mile, say five
      hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature is a wonderful thing, and great are its resources in extremity. As
      the actual crisis approached, the weariness of these two seemed to depart,
      or at any rate it was forgotten. They no longer felt exhausted, nor, had
      they been fresh from their beds, could they have climbed or run better.
      Even the horse seemed to find new energy, and when it lagged Mr. Clifford
      dug the point of his hunting knife into its flank. Gasping, panting, now
      one mounted and now the other, they struggled on towards that crest of
      rock, while behind them came death in the shape of those sleuth-hounds of
      Matabele. The sun was going down, and against its flaming ball, when they
      glanced back they could see their dark forms outlined; the broad spears
      also looked red as though they had been dipped in blood. They could even
      hear their taunting shouts as they called to them to sit down and be
      killed, and save trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they were not three hundred yards away, and the crest of the pass was
      still half a mile ahead. Five minutes passed, and here, where the track
      was very rough, the horse blundered upwards slowly. Mr. Clifford was
      riding at the time, and Benita running at his side, holding to the stirrup
      leather. She looked behind her. The savages, fearing that their victims
      might find shelter over the hill, were making a rush, and the horse could
      go no faster. One man, a great tall fellow, quite out-distanced his
      companions. Two minutes more and he was not over a hundred paces from
      them, a little nearer than they were to the top of the pass. Then the
      horse stopped and refused to stir any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford jumped from the saddle, and Benita, who could not speak,
      pointed to the pursuing Matabele. He sat down upon a rock, cocked his
      rifle, took a deep breath, and aimed and fired at the soldier who was
      coming on carelessly in the open. Mr. Clifford was a good shot, and shaken
      though he was, at this supreme moment his skill did not fail him. The man
      was struck somewhere, for he staggered about and fell; then slowly picked
      himself up, and began to hobble back towards his companions, who, when
      they met him, stopped a minute to give him some kind of assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      That halt proved their salvation, for it gave them time to make one last
      despairing rush, and gain the brow of the poort. Not that this would have
      saved them, however, since where they could go the Matabele could follow,
      and there was still light by which the pursuers would have been able to
      see to catch them. Indeed, the savages, having laid down the wounded man,
      came on with a yell of rage, fifty or more of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the pass father and daughter struggled, Benita riding; after them,
      perhaps sixty yards away, ran the Matabele, gathered in a knot now upon
      the narrow, ancient road, bordered by steep hillsides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly from all about them, as it appeared to Benita, broke out the
      blaze and roar of rifles, rapid and continuous. Down went the Matabele by
      twos and threes, till at last it seemed as though but quite a few of them
      were left upon their feet, and those came on no more; they turned and fled
      from the neck of the narrow pass to the open slope beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benita sank to the ground, and the next thing that she could remember was
      hearing the soft voice of Jacob Meyer, who said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have returned from your ride, Miss Clifford, and perhaps it was as
      well that the thought came from you to me that you wished me to meet you
      here in this very place.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BACK AT BAMBATSE
    </h3>
    <p>
      How they reached Bambatse Benita never could remember, but afterwards she
      was told that both she and her father were carried upon litters made of
      ox-hide shields. When she came to her own mind again, it was to find
      herself lying in her tent outside the mouth of the cave within the third
      enclosure of the temple-fortress. Her feet were sore and her bones ached,
      physical discomforts that brought back to her in a flash all the terrors
      through which she had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she saw the fierce pursuing Matabele; again heard their cruel shouts
      and the answering crack of the rifles; again, amidst the din and the
      gathering darkness, distinguished the gentle, foreign voice of Meyer
      speaking his words of sarcastic greeting. Next oblivion fell upon her, and
      after it a dim memory of being helped up the hill with the sun pouring on
      her back and assisted to climb the steep steps of the wall by means of a
      rope placed around her. Then forgetfulness again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flap of her tent was drawn aside and she shrank back upon her bed,
      shutting her eyes for fear lest they should fall upon the face of Jacob
      Meyer. Feeling that it was not he, or learning it perhaps from the
      footfall, she opened them a little, peeping at her visitor from between
      her long lashes. He proved to be&mdash;not Jacob or her father, but the
      old Molimo, who stood beside her holding in his hand a gourd filled with
      goat&rsquo;s milk. Then she sat up and smiled at him, for Benita had grown very
      fond of this ancient man, who was so unlike anyone that she had ever met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Greeting, Lady,&rdquo; he said softly, smiling back at her with his lips and
      dreamy eyes, for his old face did not seem to move beneath its thousand
      wrinkles. &ldquo;I bring you milk. Drink; it is fresh and you need food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she took the gourd and drank to the last drop, for it seemed to her
      that she had never tasted anything so delicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, good,&rdquo; murmured the Molimo; &ldquo;now you will be well again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I shall get well,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but oh! what of my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear not; he is still sick, but he will recover also. You shall see him
      soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have drunk all the milk,&rdquo; she broke out; &ldquo;there is none left for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty, plenty,&rdquo; he answered, waving his thin hand. &ldquo;There are two cups
      full&mdash;one for each. We have not many she-goats down below, but the
      best of their milk is saved for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me all that has happened, Father,&rdquo; and the old priest, who liked her
      to call him by that name, smiled again with his eyes, and squatted down in
      the corner of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went away, you remember that you would go, although I told you that
      you must come back. You refused my wisdom and you went, and I have learned
      all that befell you and how you two escaped the impi. Well, that night
      after sunset, when you did not return, came the Black One&mdash;yes, yes,
      I mean Meyer, whom we name so because of his beard, and,&rdquo; he added
      deliberately, &ldquo;his heart. He came running down the hill asking for you,
      and I gave him the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He read it, and oh! then he went mad. He cursed in his own tongue; he
      threw himself about; he took a rifle and wished to shoot me, but I sat
      silent and looked at him till he grew quiet. Then he asked why I had
      played him this trick, but I answered that it was no trick of mine who had
      no right to keep you and your father prisoners against your will, and that
      I thought you had gone away because you were afraid of him, which was not
      wonderful if that was how he talked to you. I told him, too, I who am a
      doctor, that unless he was careful he would go mad; that already I saw
      madness in his eye; after which he became quiet, for my words frightened
      him. Then he asked what could be done, and I said&mdash;that night,
      nothing, since you must be far away, so that it would be useless to follow
      you, but better to go to meet you when you came back. He asked what I
      meant by your coming back, and I answered that I meant what I said, that
      you would come back in great haste and peril&mdash;although you would not
      believe me when I told you so&mdash;for I had it from the Munwali whose
      child you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I sent out my spies, and that night went by, and the next day and
      night went by, and we sat still and did nothing, though the Black One
      wished to wander out alone after you. But on the following morning, at the
      dawn, a messenger came in who reported that it had been called to him by
      his brethren who were hidden upon hilltops and in other places for miles
      and miles, that the Matabele impi, having destroyed another family of the
      Makalanga far down the Zambesi, was advancing to destroy us also. And in
      the afternoon came a second spy, who reported that you two had been
      surrounded by the impi, but had broken through them, and were riding
      hitherward for your lives. Then I took fifty of the best of our people and
      put them under the command of Tamas, my son, and sent them to ambush the
      pass, for against the Matabele warriors on the plain we, who are not
      warlike, do not dare to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Black One went with them, and when he saw how sore was your strait,
      wished to run down to meet the Matabele, for he is a brave man. But I had
      said to Tamas&mdash;&lsquo;No, do not try to fight them in the open, for there
      they will certainly kill you.&rsquo; Moreover, Lady, I was sure that you would
      reach the top of the poort. Well, you reached it, though but by the
      breadth of a blade of grass, and my children shot with the new rifles, and
      the place being narrow so that they could not miss, killed many of those
      hyenas of Amandabele. But to kill Matabele is like catching fleas on a
      dog&rsquo;s back: there are always more. Still it served its turn, you and your
      father were brought away safely, and we lost no one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, then, are the Matabele now?&rdquo; asked Benita.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Outside our walls, a whole regiment of them: three thousand men or more,
      under the command of the Captain Maduna, he of the royal blood, whose life
      you begged, but who nevertheless hunted you like a buck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he did not know who it was,&rdquo; suggested Benita.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; the Molimo answered, rubbing his chin, &ldquo;for in such matters
      even a Matabele generally keeps faith, and you may remember he promised
      you life for life. However, they are here ravening like lions round the
      walls, and that is why we carried you up to the top of the hill, that you
      might be safe from them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you safe, my Father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; he replied with a dry little chuckle in his throat. &ldquo;Whoever
      built this fortress built it strong, and we have blocked the gates. Also,
      they caught no one outside; all are within the walls, together with the
      sheep and goats. Lastly, we have sent most of the women and children
      across the Zambesi in canoes, to hide in places we know of whither the
      Amandabele cannot follow, for they dare not swim a river. Therefore, for
      those of us that remain we have food for three months, and before then the
      rains will drive the impi out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not all go across the river, Father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For two reasons, Lady. The first is, that if we once abandoned our
      stronghold, which we have held from the beginning, Lobengula would take
      it, and keep it, so that we could never re-enter into our heritage, which
      would be a shame to us and bring down the vengeance of the spirits of our
      ancestors upon our heads. The second is, that as you have returned to us
      we stay to protect you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good to me,&rdquo; murmured Benita.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, we brought you here, and we do what I am told to do from Above.
      Trouble may still come upon you; yes, I think that it will come, but once
      more I pray you, have no fear, for out of this evil root shall spring a
      flower of joy,&rdquo; and he rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said Benita. &ldquo;Has the chief Meyer found the gold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he has found nothing; but he hunts and hunts like a hungry jackal
      digging for a bone. But that bone is not for him; it is for you, Lady, you
      and you only. Oh! I know, you do not seek, still you shall find. Only the
      next time that you want help, do not run away into the wilderness. Hear
      the word of Munwali given by his mouth, the Molimo of Bambatse!&rdquo; And as he
      spoke, the old priest backed himself out of the tent, stopping now and
      again to bow to Benita.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later her father entered, looking very weak and shaken, and
      supporting himself upon a stick. Happy was the greeting of these two who,
      with their arms about each other&rsquo;s neck, gave thanks for their escape from
      great peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Benita, we can&rsquo;t get away from this place,&rdquo; Mr. Clifford said
      presently. &ldquo;We must find that gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bother the gold,&rdquo; she answered with energy; &ldquo;I hate its very name. Who
      can think of gold with three thousand Matabele waiting to kill us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somehow I don&rsquo;t feel afraid of them any more,&rdquo; said her father; &ldquo;they
      have had their chance and lost it, and the Makalanga swear that now they
      have guns to command the gates, the fortress cannot be stormed. Still, I
      am afraid of someone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacob Mayer. I have seen him several times, and I think that he is going
      mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Molimo said that too, but why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the look of him. He sits about muttering and glowing with those dark
      eyes of his, and sometimes groans, and sometimes bursts into shouts of
      laughter. That is when the fit is on him, for generally he seems right
      enough. But get up if you think you can, and you shall judge for
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; said Benita feebly. &ldquo;Father, I am more afraid of him
      now than ever. Oh! why did you not let me stop down below, among the
      Makalanga, instead of carrying me up here again, where we must live alone
      with that terrible Jew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wished to, dear, but the Molimo said we should be safer above, and
      ordered his people to carry you up. Also, Jacob swore that unless you were
      brought back he would kill me. Now you understand why I believe that he is
      mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, why?&rdquo; gasped Benita again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; he answered with a groan; &ldquo;but I think that he is sure that
      we shall never find the gold without you, since the Molimo has told him
      that it is for you and you alone, and he says the old man has second
      sight, or something of the sort. Well, he would have murdered me&mdash;I
      saw it in his eye&mdash;so I thought it better to give in rather than that
      you should be left here sick and alone. Of course there was one way&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       and he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To shoot him before he shot me,&rdquo; he answered in a whisper, &ldquo;for your
      sake, dear&mdash;but I could not bring myself to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said with a shudder, &ldquo;not that&mdash;not that. Better that we
      should die than that his blood should be upon our hands. Now I will get up
      and try to show no fear. I am sure that is best, and perhaps we shall be
      able to escape somehow. Meanwhile, let us humour him, and pretend to go on
      looking for this horrible treasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Benita rose to discover that, save for her stiffness, she was but
      little the worse, and finding all things placed in readiness, set to work
      with her father&rsquo;s help to cook the evening meal as usual. Of Meyer, who
      doubtless had placed things in readiness, she saw nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before nightfall he came, however, as she knew he would. Indeed, although
      she heard no step and her back was towards him, she felt his presence; the
      sense of it fell upon her like a cold shadow. Turning round she beheld the
      man. He was standing close by, but above her, upon a big granite boulder,
      in climbing which his soft veld schoons, or hide shoes, had made no noise,
      for Meyer could move like a cat. The last rays from the sinking sun struck
      him full, outlining his agile, nervous shape against the sky, and in their
      intense red light, which flamed upon him, he appeared terrible. He looked
      like a panther about to spring; his eyes shone like a panther&rsquo;s, and
      Benita knew that she was the prey whom he desired. Still, remembering her
      resolution, she determined to show no fear, and addressed him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Mr. Meyer. Oh! I am so stiff that I cannot lift my neck to
      look at you,&rdquo; and she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bounded softly from the rock, like a panther again, and stood in front
      of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should thank the God you believe in,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that by now you are
      not stiff indeed&mdash;all that the jackals have left of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, Mr. Meyer, and I thank you, too; it was brave of you to come out to
      save us. Father,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;come and tell Mr. Meyer how grateful we are
      to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford hobbled out from his hut under the tree, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told him already, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Jacob, &ldquo;you have told me; why repeat yourself? I see that
      supper is ready. Let us eat, for you must be hungry; afterwards I have
      something to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they ate, with no great appetite, any of them&mdash;indeed Meyer
      touched but little food, though he drank a good deal, first of strong
      black coffee and afterwards of squareface and water. But on Benita he
      pressed the choicest morsels that he could find, eyeing her all the while,
      and saying that she must take plenty of nutriment or her beauty would
      suffer and her strength wane. Benita bethought her of the fairy tales of
      her childhood, in which the ogre fed up the princess whom he purposed to
      devour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should think of your own strength, Mr. Meyer,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you cannot
      live on coffee and squareface.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all I need to-night. I am astonishingly well since you came back. I
      can never remember feeling so well, or so strong. I can do the work of
      three men, and not be tired; all this afternoon, for instance, I have been
      carrying provisions and other things up that steep wall, for we must
      prepare for a long siege together; yet I should never know that I had
      lifted a single basket. But while you were away&mdash;ah! then I felt
      tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita changed the subject, asking him if he had made any discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, but now that you are back the discoveries will soon come. Do not
      be afraid; I have my plan which cannot fail. Also, it was lonely working
      in that cave without you, so I only looked about a little outside till it
      was time to go to meet you, and shoot some of those Matabele. Do you know?&mdash;I
      killed seven of them myself. When I was shooting for your sake I could not
      miss,&rdquo; and he smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benita shrank from him visibly, and Mr. Clifford said in an angry voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of those horrors before my daughter. It is bad enough to have
      to do such things, without speaking about them afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he replied reflectively; &ldquo;and I apologise, though
      personally I never enjoyed anything so much as shooting those Matabele.
      Well, they are gone, and there are plenty more outside. Listen! They are
      singing their evening hymn,&rdquo; and with his long finger he beat time to the
      volleying notes of the dreadful Matabele war-chant, which floated up from
      the plain below. &ldquo;It sounds quite religious, doesn&rsquo;t it? only the words&mdash;no,
      I will not translate them. In our circumstances they are too personal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I have something to say to you. It was unkind of you to run away and
      leave me like that, not honourable either. Indeed,&rdquo; he added with a sudden
      outbreak of the panther ferocity, &ldquo;had you alone been concerned, Clifford,
      I tell you frankly that when we met again, I should have shot you.
      Traitors deserve to be shot, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please stop talking to my father like that,&rdquo; broke in Benita in a stern
      voice, for her anger had overcome her fear. &ldquo;Also it is I whom you should
      blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pleasure to obey you,&rdquo; he answered bowing; &ldquo;I will never mention
      the subject any more. Nor do I blame you&mdash;who could?&mdash;not Jacob
      Meyer. I quite understand that you found it very dull up here, and ladies
      must be allowed their fancies. Also you have come back; so why talk of the
      matter? But listen: on one point I have made up my mind; for your own sake
      you shall not go away any more until we leave this together. When I had
      finished carrying up the food I made sure of that. If you go to look
      to-morrow morning you will find that no one can come up that wall&mdash;and,
      what is more, no one can go down it. Moreover, that I may be quite
      certain, in future I shall sleep near the stair myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita and her father stared at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Molimo has a right to come,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it is his sanctuary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he must celebrate his worship down below for a little while. The old
      fool pretends to know everything, but he never guessed what I was going to
      do. Besides, we don&rsquo;t want him breaking in upon our privacy, do we? He
      might see the gold when we find it, and rob us of it afterwards.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE FIRST EXPERIMENT
    </h3>
    <p>
      Again Benita and her father stared at each other blankly, almost with
      despair. They were trapped, cut off from all help; in the power of a man
      who was going mad. Mr. Clifford said nothing. He was old and growing
      feeble; for years, although he did not know it, Meyer had dominated him,
      and never more so than in this hour of stress and bewilderment. Moreover,
      the man had threatened to murder him, and he was afraid, not so much for
      himself as for his daughter. If he were to die now, what would happen to
      her, left alone with Jacob Meyer? The knowledge of his own folly,
      understood too late, filled him with shame. How could he have been so
      wicked as to bring a girl upon such a quest in the company of an
      unprincipled Jew, of whose past he knew nothing except that it was murky
      and dubious? He had committed a great crime, led on by a love of lucre,
      and the weight of it pressed upon his tongue and closed his lips; he knew
      not what to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a little while Benita was silent also; hope died within her. But she
      was a bold-spirited woman, and by degrees her courage re-asserted itself.
      Indignation filled her breast and shone through her dark eyes. Suddenly
      she turned upon Jacob, who sat before them smoking his pipe and enjoying
      their discomfiture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you?&rdquo; she asked in a low, concentrated voice. &ldquo;How dare you, you
      coward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrank a little beneath her scorn and anger; then seemed to recover and
      brace himself, as one does who feels that a great struggle is at hand,
      upon the issue of which everything depends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be angry with me,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I cannot bear it. It hurts&mdash;ah!
      you don&rsquo;t know how it hurts. Well, I will tell you, and before your
      father, for that is more honourable. I dare&mdash;for your sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my sake? How can it benefit me to be cooped up in this horrible place
      with you? I would rather trust myself with the Makalanga, or even,&rdquo; she
      added with bitter scorn, &ldquo;even with those bloody-minded Matabele.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ran away from them very fast a little while ago, Miss Clifford. But
      you do not understand me. When I said for your sake, I meant for my own.
      See, now. You tried to leave me the other day and did not succeed. Another
      time you might succeed, and then&mdash;what would happen to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, Mr. Meyer,&rdquo; and her eyes added&mdash;&ldquo;I do not care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but I know. Last time it drove me nearly mad; next time I should go
      quite mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you believe that through me you will find this treasure of which
      you dream day and night, Mr. Meyer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he interrupted quickly. &ldquo;Because I believe that in you I shall find
      the treasure of which I dream day and night, and because that treasure has
      become necessary to my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita turned quickly towards her father, who was puzzling over the words,
      but before either of them could speak Jacob passed his hand across his
      brow in a bewildered way and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was I talking of? The treasure, yes, the uncountable treasure of
      pure gold, that lies hid so deep, that is so hard to discover and to
      possess; the useless, buried treasure that would bring such joy and glory
      to us both, if only it could be come at and reckoned out, piece by piece,
      coin by coin, through the long, long years of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he paused; then went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Clifford, you are quite right; that is why I have dared to
      make you a prisoner, because, as the old Molimo said, the treasure is
      yours and I wish to share it. Now, about this treasure, it seems that it
      can&rsquo;t be found, can it, although I have worked so hard?&rdquo; and he looked at
      his delicate, scarred hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, Mr. Meyer, it can&rsquo;t be found, so you had better let us go down
      to the Makalanga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is a way, Miss Clifford, there is a way. You know where it
      lies, and you can show me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I knew I would show you soon enough, Mr. Meyer, for then you could
      take the stuff and our partnership would be at an end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until it is divided ounce by ounce and coin by coin. But first&mdash;first
      you must show me, as you say you will, and as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, Mr. Meyer? I am not a magician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but you are. I will tell you how, having your promise. Listen now,
      both of you. I have studied. I know a great many secret things, and I read
      in your face that you have the gift&mdash;let me look in your eyes a
      while, Miss Clifford, and you will go to sleep quite gently, and then in
      your sleep, which shall not harm you at all, you will see where that gold
      lies hidden, and you will tell us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Benita, bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what he means,&rdquo; broke in Mr. Clifford. &ldquo;You mean that you want to
      mesmerize her as you did the Zulu chief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita opened her lips to speak, but Meyer said quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; hear me first before you refuse. You have the gift, the precious
      gift of clairvoyance, that is so rare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that, Mr. Meyer? I have never been mesmerized in my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not matter how. I do know it; I have been sure of it from the
      moment when first we met, that night by the kloof. Although, perhaps, you
      felt nothing then, it was that gift of yours working upon a mind in tune,
      my mind, which led me there in time to save you, as it was that gift of
      yours which warned you of the disaster about to happen to the ship&mdash;oh!
      I have heard the story from your own lips. Your spirit can loose itself
      from the body: it can see the past and the future; it can discover the
      hidden things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe it,&rdquo; answered Benita; &ldquo;but at least it shall not be
      loosed by you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall, it shall,&rdquo; he cried with passion, his eyes blazing on her as he
      spoke. &ldquo;Oh! I foresaw all this, and that is why I was determined you
      should come with us, so that, should other means fail, we might have your
      power to fall back upon. Well, they have failed; I have been patient, I
      have said nothing, but now there is no other way. Will you be so selfish,
      so cruel, as to deny me, you who can make us all rich in an hour, and take
      no hurt at all, no more than if you had slept awhile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Benita. &ldquo;I refuse to deliver my will into the keeping of
      any living man, and least of all into yours, Mr. Meyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to her father with a gesture of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot you persuade her, Clifford? She is your daughter, she will obey
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in that,&rdquo; said Benita.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Mr. Clifford. &ldquo;I cannot, and I wouldn&rsquo;t if I could. My
      daughter is quite right. Moreover, I hate this supernatural kind of thing.
      If we can&rsquo;t find this gold without it, then we must let it alone, that is
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meyer turned aside to hide his face, and presently looked up again, and
      spoke quite softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that I must accept my answer, but when you talked of any living
      man just now, Miss Clifford, did you include your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then will you allow him to try to mesmerize you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, if he likes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I do not think that the operation
      will be very successful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, we will see to-morrow. Now, like you, I am tired. I am going to bed
      in my new camp by the wall,&rdquo; he added significantly.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you so dead set against this business?&rdquo; asked her father, when he
      had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father!&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you see, don&rsquo;t you understand? Then it
      is hard to have to tell you, but I must. In the beginning Mr. Meyer only
      wanted the gold. Now he wants more, me as well as the gold. I hate him!
      You know that is why I ran away. But I have read a good deal about this
      mesmerism, and seen it once or twice, and who knows? If once I allow his
      mind to master my mind, although I hate him so much, I might become his
      slave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand now,&rdquo; said Mr. Clifford. &ldquo;Oh, why did I ever bring you here?
      It would have been better if I had never seen your face again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow the experiment was made. Mr. Clifford attempted to mesmerize
      his daughter. All the morning Jacob, who, it now appeared, had practical
      knowledge of this doubtful art, tried to instruct him therein. In the
      course of the lesson he informed him that for a short period in the past,
      having great natural powers in that direction, he had made use of them
      professionally, only giving up the business because he found it wrecked
      his health. Mr. Clifford remarked that he had never told him that before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are lots of things in my life that I have never told you,&rdquo; replied
      Jacob with a little secret smile. &ldquo;For instance, once I mesmerized you,
      although you did not know it, and that is why you always have to do what I
      want you to, except when your daughter is near you, for her influence is
      stronger than mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder Benita won&rsquo;t let you mesmerize her,&rdquo; he said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Jacob saw his mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are more foolish than I thought,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How could I mesmerize you
      without your knowing it? I was only laughing at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see the laugh,&rdquo; replied Mr. Clifford uneasily, and they went on
      with the lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon it was put to proof&mdash;in the cave itself, where Meyer
      seemed to think that the influences would be propitious. Benita, who found
      some amusement in the performance, was seated upon the stone steps
      underneath the crucifix, one lamp on the altar and others one each side of
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front stood her father, staring at her and waving his hands
      mysteriously in obedience to Jacob&rsquo;s directions. So ridiculous did he look
      indeed while thus engaged that Benita had the greatest difficulty in
      preventing herself from bursting into laughter. This was the only effect
      which his grimaces and gesticulations produced upon her, although
      outwardly she kept a solemn appearance, and even from time to time shut
      her eyes to encourage him. Once, when she opened them again, it was to
      perceive that he was becoming very hot and exhausted, and that Jacob was
      watching him with such an unpleasant intentness that she re-closed her
      eyes that she might not see his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was shortly after this that of a sudden Benita did feel something, a
      kind of penetrating power flowing upon her, something soft and subtle that
      seemed to creep into her brain like the sound of her mother&rsquo;s lullaby in
      the dim years ago. She began to think that she was a lost traveller among
      alpine snows wrapped round by snow, falling, falling in ten myriad flakes,
      every one of them with a little heart of fire. Then it came to her that
      she had heard this snow-sleep was dangerous, the last of all sleeps, and
      that its victims must rouse themselves, or die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benita roused herself just in time&mdash;only just, for now she was being
      borne over the edge of a precipice upon the wings of swans, and beneath
      her was darkness wherein dim figures walked with lamps where their hearts
      should be. Oh, how heavy were her eyelids! Surely a weight hung to each of
      them, a golden weight. There, there, they were open, and she saw. Her
      father had ceased his efforts; he was rubbing his brow with a red
      pocket-handkerchief, but behind him, with rigid arms outstretched, his
      glowing eyes fastened on her face, stood Jacob Meyer. By an effort she
      sprang to her feet, shaking her head as a dog does.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have done with this nonsense,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It tires me,&rdquo; and snatching one
      of the lamps she ran swiftly down the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benita expected that Jacob Meyer would be very angry with her, and braced
      herself for a scene. But nothing of the sort happened. A while afterwards
      she saw the two of them approaching, engaged apparently in amicable talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Meyer says that I am no mesmerist, love,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;and I can
      quite believe him. But for all that it is a weary job. I am as tired as I
      was after our escape from the Matabele.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To judge by results I agree with you. The occult is not in your line,
      father. You had better give it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you, then, feel nothing?&rdquo; asked Meyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; she answered, looking him in the eyes. &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s
      wrong, I felt extremely bored and sorry to see my father making himself
      ridiculous. Grey hairs and nonsense of that sort don&rsquo;t go well together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I agree with you&mdash;not of that sort,&rdquo; and the
      subject dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next few days, to her intense relief, Benita heard no more of
      mesmerism. To begin with, there was something else to occupy their minds.
      The Matabele, tired of marching round the fortress and singing endless
      war-songs, had determined upon an assault. From their point of vantage on
      the topmost wall the three could watch the preparations which they made.
      Trees were cut down and brought in from a great distance that rude ladders
      might be fashioned out of them; also spies wandered round reconnoitring
      for a weak place in the defences. When they came too near the Makalanga
      fired on them, killing some, so that they retreated to the camp, which
      they had made in a fold of ground at a little distance. Suddenly it
      occurred to Meyer that although here the Matabele were safe from the
      Makalanga bullets, it was commanded from the greater eminence, and by way
      of recreation he set himself to harass them. His rifle was a sporting
      Martini, and he had an ample supply of ammunition. Moreover, he was a
      beautiful marksman, with sight like that of a hawk.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few trial shots gave him the range; it was a shade under seven hundred
      yards, and then he began operations. Lying on the top of the wall and
      resting his rifle upon a stone, he waited until the man who was
      superintending the manufacture of the ladders came out into the open,
      when, aiming carefully, he fired. The soldier, a white-bearded savage,
      sprang into the air, and fell backwards, while his companions stared
      upwards, wondering whence the bullet had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Meyer to Benita, who was watching through a pair
      of field-glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to see any more,&rdquo; and giving
      the glasses to her father, she climbed down the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Meyer stayed there, and from time to time she heard the report of his
      rifle. In the evening he told her that he had killed six men and wounded
      ten more, adding that it was the best day&rsquo;s shooting which he could
      remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the use when there are so many?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But it annoys them and amuses me. Also, it was
      part of our bargain that we should help the Makalanga if they were
      attacked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that you like killing people,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind it, Miss Clifford, especially as they tried to kill you.&rdquo;

    <h3>
      THE OTHER BENITA
    </h3>
    <p>
      At irregular times, when he had nothing else to do, Jacob went on with his
      man-shooting, in which Mr. Clifford joined him, though with less effect.
      Soon it became evident that the Matabele were very much annoyed by the
      fatal accuracy of this fire. Loss of life they did not mind in the
      abstract, but when none of them knew but that their own turn might come
      next to perish beneath these downward plunging bullets, the matter wore a
      different face to them. To leave their camp was not easy, since they had
      made a thorn <i>boma</i> round it, to protect them in case the Makalanga
      should make a night sally; also they could find no other convenient spot.
      The upshot of it all was to hurry their assault, which they delivered
      before they had prepared sufficient ladders to make it effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first break of dawn on the third day after Mr. Clifford&rsquo;s attempt
      at mesmerism, Benita was awakened by the sounds of shouts and firing.
      Having dressed herself hastily, she hurried in the growing light towards
      that part of the wall from below which the noise seemed to come, and
      climbing it, found her father and Jacob already seated there, their rifles
      in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fools are attacking the small gate through which you went out riding,
      Miss Clifford, the very worst place that they could have chosen, although
      the wall looks very weak there,&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;If those Makalanga have
      any pluck they ought to teach them a lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the sun rose and they saw companies of Matabele, who carried ladders
      in their hands, rushing onwards through the morning mist till their sight
      of them was obstructed by the swell of the hill. On these companies the
      two white men opened fire, with what result they could not see in that
      light. Presently a great shout announced that the enemy had gained the
      fosse and were setting up the ladders. Up to this time the Makalanga
      appeared to have done nothing, but now they began to fire rapidly from the
      ancient bastions which commanded the entrance the impi was striving to
      storm, and soon through the thinning fog they perceived wounded Matabele
      staggering and crawling back towards their camp. Of these, the light now
      better, Jacob did not neglect to take his toll.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the ancient fortress rang with the hideous tumult of the
      attack. It was evident that again and again, as their fierce war-shouts
      proclaimed, the Matabele were striving to scale the wall, and again and
      again were beaten back by the raking rifle fire. Once a triumphant yell
      seemed to announce their success. The fire slackened and Benita grew pale
      with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Makalanga cowards are bolting,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Clifford, listening with
      terrible anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if so their courage came back to them, for presently the guns cracked
      louder and more incessant than before, and the savage cries of &ldquo;Kill!
      Kill! Kill!&rdquo; dwindled and died away. Another five minutes and the Matabele
      were in full retreat, bearing with them many dead and wounded men upon
      their backs or stretched out on the ladders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Makalanga friends should be grateful to us for those hundred rifles,&rdquo;
       said Jacob as he loaded and fired rapidly, sending his bullets wherever
      the clusters were thickest. &ldquo;Had it not been for them their throats would
      have been cut by now,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;for they could never have stopped those
      savages with the spear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and ours too before nightfall,&rdquo; said Benita with a shudder, for the
      sight of this desperate fray and fear of how it might end had sickened
      her. &ldquo;Thank Heaven, it is over! Perhaps they will give up the siege and go
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, notwithstanding their costly defeat, for they had lost over a hundred
      men, the Matabele, who were afraid to return to Buluwayo except as
      victors, did nothing of the sort. They only cut down a quantity of reeds
      and scrub, and moved their camp nearly to the banks of the river, placing
      it in such a position that it could no longer be searched by the fire of
      the two white men. Here they sat themselves down sullenly, hoping to
      starve out the garrison or to find some other way of entering the
      fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Meyer&rsquo;s shooting having come to an end for lack of men to shoot at,
      since the enemy exposed themselves no more, he was again able to give his
      full attention to the matter of the treasure hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      As nothing could be found in the cave he devoted himself to the outside
      enclosure which, it may be remembered, was grown over with grass and trees
      and crowded with ruins. In the most important of these ruins they began to
      dig somewhat aimlessly, and were rewarded by finding a certain amount of
      gold in the shape of beads and ornaments, and a few more skeletons of
      ancients. But of the Portuguese hoard there was no sign. Thus it came
      about that they grew gloomier day by day, till at last they scarcely spoke
      to each other. Jacob&rsquo;s angry disappointment was written on his face, and
      Benita was filled with despair, since to escape from their gaoler above
      and the Matabele below seemed impossible. Moreover, she had another cause
      for anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ill-health which had been threatening her father for a long while now
      fell upon him in earnest, so that of a sudden he became a very old man.
      His strength and energy left him, and his mind was so filled with remorse
      for what he held to be his crime in bringing his daughter to this awful
      place, and with terror for the fate that threatened her, that he could
      think of nothing else. In vain did she try to comfort him. He would only
      wring his hands and groan, praying that God and she would forgive him.
      Now, too, Meyer&rsquo;s mastery over him became continually more evident. Mr.
      Clifford implored the man, almost with tears, to unblock the wall and
      allow them to go down to the Makalanga. He even tried to bribe him with
      the offer of all his share of the treasure, if it were found, and when
      that failed, of his property in the Transvaal.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jacob only told him roughly not to be a fool, as they had to see the
      thing through together. Then he would go again and brood by himself, and
      Benita noticed that he always took his rifle or a pistol with him.
      Evidently he feared lest her father should catch him unprepared, and take
      the law into his own hands by means of a sudden bullet.
    </p>
    <p>
      One comfort she had, however: although he watched her closely, the Jew
      never tried to molest her in any way, not even with more of his enigmatic
      and amorous speeches. By degrees, indeed, she came to believe that all
      this was gone from his mind, or that he had abandoned his advances as
      hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week passed since the Matabele attack, and nothing had happened. The
      Makalanga took no notice of them, and so far as she was aware the old
      Molimo never attempted to climb the blocked wall or otherwise to
      communicate with them, a thing so strange that, knowing his affection for
      her, Benita came to the conclusion that he must be dead, killed perhaps in
      the attack. Even Jacob Meyer had abandoned his digging, and sat about all
      day doing nothing but think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their meal that night was a miserable affair, since in the first place
      provisions were running short and there was little to eat, and in the
      second no one spoke a word. Benita could swallow no food; she was weary of
      that sun-dried trek-ox, for since Meyer had blocked the wall they had
      little else. But by good fortune there remained plenty of coffee, and of
      this she drank two cups, which Jacob prepared and handed to her with much
      politeness. It tasted very bitter to her, but this, Benita reflected, was
      because they lacked milk and sugar. Supper ended, Meyer rose and bowed to
      her, muttering that he was going to bed, and a few minutes later Mr.
      Clifford followed his example. She went with her father to the hut beneath
      the tree, and having helped him to remove his coat, which now he seemed to
      find difficulty in doing for himself, bade him good-night and returned to
      the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very lonely there in the silence, for no sound came from either the
      Matabele or the Makalanga camps, and the bright moonlight seemed to people
      the place with fantastic shadows that looked alive. Benita cried a little
      now that her father could not see her, and then also sought refuge in bed.
      Evidently the end, whatever it might be, was near, and of it she could not
      bear to think. Moreover, her eyes were strangely heavy, so much so that
      before she had finished saying her prayers sleep fell upon her, and she
      knew no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she remained as wakeful as it was often her fate to be during those
      fearful days, towards midnight she might have heard some light-footed
      creature creeping to her tent, and seen that the moon-rays which flowed
      through the gaping and ill-closed flap were cut off by the figure of a man
      with glowing eyes, whose projected arms waved over her mysteriously. But
      Benita neither heard nor saw. In her drugged rest she did not know that
      her sleep turned gradually to a magic swoon. She had no knowledge of her
      rising, or of how she threw her thick cloak about her, lit her lamp, and,
      in obedience to that beckoning finger, glided from the tent. She never
      heard her father stumble from his hut, disturbed by the sound of
      footsteps, or the words that passed between him and Jacob Meyer, while,
      lamp in hand, she stood near them like a strengthless ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you dare to wake her,&rdquo; hissed Jacob, &ldquo;I tell you that she will die,
      and afterwards you shall die,&rdquo; and he fingered the pistol at his belt. &ldquo;No
      harm shall come to her&mdash;I swear it! Follow and see. Man, man, be
      silent; our fortunes hang on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, overcome also by the strange fierceness of that voice and gaze, he
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On they go to the winding neck of the cavern, first Jacob walking
      backwards like the herald of majesty; then majesty itself in the shape of
      this long-haired, death-like woman, cloaked and bearing in her hand the
      light; and last, behind, the old, white-bearded man, like Time following
      Beauty to the grave. Now they were in the great cavern, and now, avoiding
      the open tombs, the well mouth and the altar, they stood beneath the
      crucifix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be seated,&rdquo; said Meyer, and the entranced Benita sat herself down upon
      the steps at the foot of the cross, placing the lamp on the rock pavement
      before her, and bowing her head till her hair fell upon her naked feet and
      hid them. He held his hands above her for a while, then asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you sleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sleep,&rdquo; came the strange, slow answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your spirit awake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Command it to travel backwards through the ages to the beginning, and
      tell me what you see here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see a rugged cave and wild folk dwelling in it; an old man is dying
      yonder,&rdquo; and she pointed to the right; &ldquo;and a black woman with a babe at
      her breast tends him. A man, it is her husband, enters the cave. He holds
      a torch in one hand, and with the other drags a buck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cease,&rdquo; said Meyer. &ldquo;How long is this ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty-three thousand two hundred and one years,&rdquo; came the answer, spoken
      without any hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass on,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;pass on thirty thousand years, and tell me what you
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a long while there was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you not speak?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be patient; I am living through those thirty thousand years; many a life,
      many an age, but none may be missed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there was silence for a long while, till at length she spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are done, all of them, and now three thousand years ago I see this
      place changed and smoothly fashioned, peopled by a throng of worshippers
      clad in strange garments with clasps upon them. Behind me stands the
      graven statue of a goddess with a calm and cruel face, in front of the
      altar burns a fire, and on the altar white-robed priests are sacrificing
      an infant which cries aloud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass on, pass on,&rdquo; Meyer said hurriedly, as though the horror of that
      scene had leapt to his eyes. &ldquo;Pass on two thousand seven hundred years and
      tell me what you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a pause, while the spirit he had evoked in the body of
      Benita lived through those ages. Then slowly she answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, the place is black and desolate, only the dead sleep beneath its
      floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till the living come again,&rdquo; he commanded; &ldquo;then speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are here,&rdquo; she replied presently. &ldquo;Tonsured monks, one of whom
      fashions this crucifix, and their followers who bow before the Host upon
      the altar. They come, they go&mdash;of whom shall I tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me of the Portuguese; of those who were driven here to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see them all,&rdquo; she answered, after a pause. &ldquo;Two hundred and three of
      them. They are ragged and wayworn and hungry. Among them is a beautiful
      woman, a girl. She draws near to me, she enters into me. You must ask
      her,&rdquo;&mdash;this was spoken in a very faint voice&mdash;&ldquo;I am I no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford attempted to interrupt, but fiercely Meyer bade him to be
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; he commanded, but the crouching figure shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; he said again, whereon another voice, not that of Benita,
      answered in another tongue:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear; but I do not understand your language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heaven!&rdquo; said Meyer, &ldquo;it is Portuguese,&rdquo; and for a while the terror
      of the thing struck him dumb, for he was aware that Benita knew no
      Portuguese. He knew it, however, who had lived at Lorenço Marquez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked in that tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Benita da Ferreira. I am the daughter of the Captain da Ferreira and
      of his wife, the lady Christinha, who stand by you now. Turn, and you will
      see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacob started and looked about him uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she say? I did not catch it all,&rdquo; asked Mr. Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      He translated her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is black magic,&rdquo; exclaimed the old man. &ldquo;Benita knows no
      Portuguese, so how comes she to speak it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she is no longer our Benita; she is another Benita, Benita da
      Ferreira. The Molimo was right when he said that the spirit of the dead
      woman went with her, as it seems the name has gone,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have done,&rdquo; said Mr. Clifford; &ldquo;the thing is unholy. Wake her up, or I
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And bring about her death. Touch or disturb her, and I tell you she will
      die,&rdquo; and he pointed to Benita, who crouched before them so white and
      motionless that indeed it seemed as though already she were dead. &ldquo;Be
      quiet,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I swear to you that no hurt shall come to her, also
      that I will translate everything to you. Promise, or I will tell you
      nothing, and her blood be on your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mr. Clifford groaned and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me your story, Benita da Ferreira. How came you and your people
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tribes of Monomotapa rose against our rule. They killed many of us in
      the lower land, yes, they killed my brother and him to whom I was
      affianced. The rest of us fled north to this ancient fortress, hoping
      thence to escape by the river, the Zambesi. The Mambo, our vassal, gave us
      shelter here, but the tribes besieged the walls in thousands, and burnt
      all the boats so that we could not fly by the water. Many times we beat
      them back from the wall; the ditch was full of their dead, and at last
      they dared to attack no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we began to starve and they won the first wall. We went on starving
      and they won the second wall, but the third wall they could not climb. So
      we died; one by one we laid ourselves down in this cave and died, till I
      alone was left, for while our people had food they gave it to me who was
      the daughter of their captain. Yes, alone I knelt at the foot of this
      crucifix by the body of my father, praying to the blessed Son of Mary for
      the death that would not come, and kneeling there I swooned. When I awoke
      again the Mambo and his men stood about me, for now, knowing us to be
      dead, the tribes had gone, and those who were in hiding across the river
      had returned and knew how to climb the wall. They bore me from among the
      dead, they gave me food so that my strength came back; but in the night I,
      who in my wickedness would not live, escaped from them and climbed the
      pillar of black rock, so that when the sun rose they saw me standing
      there. They begged of me to come down, promising to protect me, but I said
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; who in the evil of my heart only desired to die, that I might join
      my father and my brother, and one who was dearer to me than all. They
      asked of me where the great treasure was hidden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words Jacob gasped, then rapidly translated them, while the
      figure before them became silent, as though it felt that for the moment
      the power of his will was withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak on, I bid you,&rdquo; he said, and she continued, the rich, slow voice
      dropping word after word from the lips of Benita in the alien speech that
      this Benita never knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I answered that it was where it was, and that if they gave it up to any
      save the one appointed, then that fate which had befallen my people would
      befall theirs also. Yes, I gave it into their keeping until I came again,
      since with his dying breath my father had commanded me to reveal it to
      none, and I believed that I who was about to die should never come again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I made my last prayer, I kissed the golden crucifix that now hangs
      upon this breast wherein I dwell,&rdquo; and the hand of the living Benita was
      lifted, and moving like the hand of a dead thing, slowly drew out the
      symbol from beneath the cloak, held it for a moment in the lamplight, and
      let it fall to its place again. &ldquo;I put my hands before my eyes that I
      might not see, and I hurled myself from the pinnacle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the voice ceased, but from the lips came a dreadful sound, such as
      might be uttered by one whose bones are shattered upon rocks, followed by
      other sounds like those of one who chokes in water. They were so horrible
      to hear that Mr. Clifford nearly fainted, and even Jacob Meyer staggered
      and turned white as the white face of Benita.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wake her! For God&rsquo;s sake, wake her!&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;She is dying, as
      that woman died hundreds of years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till she has told us where the gold is. Be quiet, you fool. She does
      not feel or suffer. It is the spirit within her that lives through the
      past again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more there was silence. It seemed as though the story were all told
      and the teller had departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benita da Ferreira,&rdquo; said Meyer at length, &ldquo;I command you, tell me, are
      you dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! would that I were dead, as my body is dead!&rdquo; wailed the lips of
      Benita. &ldquo;Alas! I cannot die who suffer this purgatory, and must dwell on
      here alone until the destined day. Yes, yes, the spirit of her who was
      Benita da Ferreira must haunt this place in solitude. This is her doom, to
      be the guardian of that accursed gold which was wrung from the earth by
      cruelty and paid for with the lives of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it still safe?&rdquo; whispered Jacob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will look;&rdquo; then after a pause, &ldquo;I have looked. It is there, every
      grain of it, in ox-hide bags; only one of them has fallen and burst, that
      which is black and red.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; he said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may not tell you; never, never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anyone whom you may tell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her in whose breast I lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told her; she knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may she tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her guard the secret as she will. O my Guardian, I thank thee. My
      burden is departed; my sin of self-murder is atoned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benita da Ferreira, are you gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benita Clifford, do you hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you,&rdquo; said the voice of Benita, speaking in English, although
      Jacob, forgetting, had addressed her in Portuguese.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the gold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my keeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, I command you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But no words came; though he questioned her many times no words came, till
      at last her head sank forward upon her knees, and in a faint voice she
      murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loose me, or I die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      XIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE AWAKING
    </h3>
    <p>
      Still Jacob Meyer hesitated. The great secret was unlearned, and, if this
      occasion passed, might never be learned. But if he hesitated, Mr. Clifford
      did not. The knowledge of his child&rsquo;s danger, the sense that her life was
      mysteriously slipping away from her under pressure of the ghastly spell in
      which she lay enthralled, stirred him to madness. His strength and manhood
      came back to him. He sprang straight at Meyer&rsquo;s throat, gripped it with
      one hand, and with the other drew the knife he wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You devil!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Wake her or you shall go with her!&rdquo; and he lifted
      the knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Jacob gave in. Shaking off his assailant he stepped to Benita, and
      while her father stood behind him with the lifted blade, began to make
      strange upward passes over her, and to mutter words of command. For a long
      while they took no effect; indeed, both of them were almost sure that she
      was gone. Despair gripped her father, and Meyer worked at his black art so
      furiously that the sweat burst out upon his forehead and fell in great
      drops to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, at last, at last she stirred! Her head lifted itself a little, her
      breast heaved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord in Heaven, I have saved her!&rdquo; muttered Jacob in German, and worked
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the eyes of Benita opened, and now she stood up and sighed. But she
      said nothing; only like a person walking in her sleep, she began to move
      towards the entrance of the cave, her father going before her with the
      lamp. On she went, and out of it straight to her tent, where instantly she
      cast herself upon her bed and sank into deep slumber. It was as though the
      power of the drug-induced oblivion, which for a while was over-mastered by
      that other stronger power invoked by Jacob, had reasserted itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meyer watched her for awhile; then said to Mr. Clifford:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid and don&rsquo;t attempt to disturb her. She will wake naturally
      in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so for both our sakes,&rdquo; he answered, glaring at him, &ldquo;for if not,
      you or I, or the two of us, will never see another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meyer took no notice of his threats; indeed the man seemed so exhausted
      that he could scarcely stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now, as she is safe, I don&rsquo;t care what happens to
      me. I must rest,&rdquo; and he staggered from the tent, like a drunken man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, at the place where they ate, Mr. Clifford heard him gulping down
      raw gin from the bottle. Then he heard no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the rest of the night, and for some hours of the early morning, did
      her father watch by the bed of Benita, although, lightly clad as he was,
      the cold of dawn struck to his bones. At length, when the sun was well up,
      she rose in her bed, and her eyes opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here, father?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to see where you were, dear. You are generally out by now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that I must have overslept myself then,&rdquo; she replied wearily.
      &ldquo;But it does not seem to have refreshed me much, and my head aches. Oh! I
      remember,&rdquo; she added with a start. &ldquo;I have had such a horrid dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about?&rdquo; he asked as carelessly as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t recall it quite, but it had to do with Mr. Meyer,&rdquo; and she
      shivered. &ldquo;It seemed as though I had passed into his power, as though he
      had taken possession of me, body and soul, and forced me to tell him all
      the secret things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What secret things, Benita?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know now, but we went away among dead people, and I told him
      there. Oh! father, I am afraid of that man&mdash;terribly afraid! Protect
      me from him,&rdquo; and she began to cry a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will protect you, dear. Something has upset your nerves.
      Come, dress yourself and you&rsquo;ll soon forget it all. I&rsquo;ll light the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour later Benita joined him, looking pale and shaken, but
      otherwise much as usual. She was ravenously hungry, and ate of the
      biscuits and dried meat with eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coffee tastes quite different from that which I drank last night,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;I think there must have been something in it which gave me
      those bad dreams. Where is Mr. Meyer? Oh, I know!&rdquo; and again she put her
      hand to her head. &ldquo;He is still asleep by the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, but it is so. He will not come here till one o&rsquo;clock. There,
      I feel much better now. What shall we do, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit in the sun and rest, I think, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, let us do that, on the top of the wall. We can see the Makalanga
      from there, and it will be a comfort to be sure that there are other human
      beings left in the world besides ourselves and Jacob Meyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So presently they went, and from the spot whence Meyer used to shoot at
      the Matabele camp, looked down upon the Makalanga moving about the first
      enclosure far below. By the aid of the glasses Benita even thought that
      she recognised Tamas, although of this it was difficult to be sure, for
      they were all very much alike. Still, the discovery quite excited her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure it is Tamas,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And oh! how I wish that we were down
      there with him, although it is true that then we should be nearer to the
      Matabele. But they are better than Mr. Meyer, much better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now for a while they were silent, till at length she said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, you are keeping something back from me, and things begin to come
      back. Tell me; did I go anywhere last night with Mr. Meyer&mdash;you and
      he and I together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated and looked guilty; Mr. Clifford was not a good actor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that we did; I am sure that we did. Father, tell me. I must know, I
      will know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to speak, dear, but perhaps it is best. It is a very
      strange story. Will you promise not to be upset?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will promise not to be more upset than I am at present,&rdquo; she answered,
      with a sad little laugh. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember that Jacob Meyer wanted to mesmerize you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not likely to forget it,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, last night he did mesmerize you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<i>What?</i> Oh! how dreadful! Now I understand it all.
      But when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you were sound asleep, I suppose. At least, the first I knew of it
      was that some noise woke me, and I came out of the hut to see you
      following him like a dead woman, with a lamp in your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he told her all the story, while she listened aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dared he!&rdquo; she gasped, when her father had finished the long tale. &ldquo;I
      hate him; I almost wish that you had killed him,&rdquo; and she clenched her
      little hands and shook them in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not very Christian of you, Miss Clifford,&rdquo; said a voice behind
      her. &ldquo;But it is past one o&rsquo;clock, and as I am still alive I have come to
      tell you that it is time for luncheon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita wheeled round upon the stone on which she sat, and there, standing
      amidst the bushes a little way from the foot of the wall, was Jacob Meyer.
      Their eyes met; hers were full of defiance, and his of conscious power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not want any luncheon, Mr. Meyer,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am sure that you do. Please come down and have some. Please come
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were spoken humbly, almost pleadingly, yet to Benita they seemed
      as a command. At any rate, with slow reluctance she climbed down the
      shattered wall, followed by her father, and without speaking they went
      back to their camping place, all three of them, Jacob leading the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had eaten, or made pretence to eat, he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that your father has told you everything, Miss Clifford, and of
      that I am glad. As for me, it would have been awkward, who must ask your
      forgiveness for so much. But what could I do? I knew, as I have always
      known, that it was only possible to find this treasure by your help. So I
      gave you something to make you sleep, and then in your sleep I hypnotized
      you, and&mdash;you know the rest. I have great experience in this art, but
      I have never seen or heard of anything like what happened, and I hope I
      never shall again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto Benita had sat silent, but now her burning indignation and
      curiosity overcame her shame and hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Meyer,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have done a shameful and a wicked thing, and I
      tell you at once that I can never forgive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. Please don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; he interrupted in tones of real
      grief. &ldquo;Make allowances for me. I had to learn, and there was no other
      way. You are a born clairvoyante, one among ten thousand, my art told me
      so, and you know all that is at stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By which you mean so many ounces of gold, Mr. Meyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By which I mean the greatness that gold can give, Miss Clifford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such greatness, Mr. Meyer, as a week of fever, or a Matabele spear, or
      God&rsquo;s will can rob you of. But the thing is done, and soon or late the sin
      must be paid for. Now I want to ask you a question. You believe in
      nothing; you have told me so several times. You say that there is no such
      thing as a spirit, that when we die, we die, and there&rsquo;s an end. Do you
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tell me, what was it that spoke out of my lips last night, and how
      came it that I, who know no Portuguese, talked to you in that tongue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have put a difficult question, but one I think that can be answered.
      There is no such thing as a spirit, an identity that survives death. But
      there is such a thing as the subconscious self, which is part of the
      animating principle of the universe, and, if only its knowledge can be
      unsealed, knows all that has passed and all that is passing in that
      universe. One day perhaps you will read the works of my compatriot, Hegel,
      and there you will find it spoken of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You explain nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am about to explain, Miss Clifford. Last night I gave to your
      sub-conscious self&mdash;that which knows all&mdash;the strength of
      liberty, so that it saw the past as it happened in this place. Already you
      knew the story of the dead girl, Benita da Ferreira, and that story you
      re-enacted, talking the tongue she used as you would have talked Greek or
      any other tongue, had it been hers. It was not her spirit that animated
      you, although at the time I called it so for shortness, but your own
      buried knowledge, tricked out and furnished by the effort of your human
      imagination. That her name, Benita, should have been yours also is no
      doubt a strange coincidence, but no more. Also we have no proof that it
      was so; only what you said in your trance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Benita, who was in no mood for philosophical argument.
      &ldquo;Perhaps also one day you will see a spirit, Mr. Meyer, and think
      otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I see a spirit and know that it is a spirit, then doubtless I shall
      believe in spirits. But what is the good of talking of such things? I do
      not seek spirits; I seek Portuguese gold. Now, I am sure you can tell
      where that gold lies. You would have told us last night, had not your
      nervous strength failed you, who are unaccustomed to the state of trance.
      Speaking as Benita da Ferreira, you said that you saw it and described its
      condition. Then you could, or would, say no more, and it became necessary
      to waken you. Miss Clifford, you must let me mesmerize you once again for
      a few minutes only, for then we will waste no time on past histories, and
      we shall find the gold. Unless, indeed,&rdquo; he added by an afterthought, and
      looking at her sharply, &ldquo;you know already where it is; in which case I
      need not trouble you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, Mr. Meyer. I remember nothing about the gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which proves my theory. What purported to be the spirit of Benita da
      Ferreira said that it had passed the secret on to you, but in your waking
      state you do not know that secret. In fact, she did not pass it on because
      she had no existence. But in your sub-conscious state you will know.
      Therefore I must mesmerize you again. Not at once, but in a few days&rsquo; 
      time, when you have quite recovered. Let us say next Wednesday, three days
      hence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall never mesmerize me again, Mr. Meyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not while I live,&rdquo; broke in her father, who had been listening to
      this discussion in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob bowed his head meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so now, but I think otherwise. What I did last night I did
      against your will, and that I can do again, only much more easily. But I
      had rather do it with your will, who work not for my own sake only, but
      for the sake of all of us. And now let us talk no more of the matter, lest
      we should grow angry.&rdquo; Then he rose and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next three days were passed by Benita in a state of constant dread.
      She knew in herself that Jacob Meyer had acquired a certain command over
      her; that an invincible intimacy had sprung up between them. She was
      acquainted with his thoughts; thus, before he asked for it, she would find
      herself passing him some article at table or elsewhere, or answering a
      question that he was only about to ask. Moreover, he could bring her to
      him from a little distance. Thus, on two or three occasions when she was
      wandering about their prison enclosure, as she was wont to do for the sake
      of exercise, she found her feet draw to some spot&mdash;now one place and
      now another&mdash;and when she reached it there before her was Jacob
      Meyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me for bringing you here,&rdquo; he would say, smiling after his
      crooked fashion, and lifting his hat politely, &ldquo;but I wish to ask you if
      you have not changed your mind as to being mesmerized?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then for a while he would hold her with his eyes, so that her feet seemed
      rooted to the ground, till at length it was as though he cut a rope by
      some action of his will and set her free, and, choked with wrath and blind
      with tears, Benita would turn and run from him as from a wild beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if her days were evil, oh! what were her nights? She lived in constant
      terror lest he should again drug her food or drink, and, while she slept,
      throw his magic spell upon her. To protect herself from the first danger
      she would swallow nothing that had been near him. Now also she slept in
      the hut with her father, who lay near its door, a loaded rifle at his
      side, for he had told Jacob outright that if he caught him at his
      practices he would shoot him, a threat at which the younger man laughed
      aloud, for he had no fear of Mr. Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the long hours of darkness they kept watch alternately, one of
      them lying down to rest while the other peered and listened. Nor did
      Benita always listen in vain, for twice at least she heard stealthy
      footsteps creeping about the hut, and felt that soft and dreadful
      influence flowing in upon her. Then she would wake her father, whispering,
      &ldquo;He is there, I can feel that he is there.&rdquo; But by the time that the old
      man had painfully dragged himself to his feet&mdash;for now he was
      becoming very feeble and acute rheumatism or some such illness had got
      hold of him&mdash;and crept from the hut, there was no one to be seen.
      Only through the darkness he would hear the sound of a retreating step,
      and of low, mocking laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus those miserable days went by, and the third morning came, that
      dreaded Wednesday. Before it was dawn Benita and her father, neither of
      whom had closed their eyes that night, talked over their strait long and
      earnestly, and they knew that its crisis was approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that I had better try to kill him, Benita,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am
      growing dreadfully weak, and if I put it off I may find no strength, and
      you will be at his mercy. I can easily shoot him when his back is turned,
      and though I hate the thought of such a deed, surely I shall be forgiven.
      Or if not, I cannot help it. I must think of my duty to you, not of
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I will not have it. It would be murder, although
      he has threatened you. After all, father, I believe that the man is half
      mad, and not responsible. We must take our chance and trust to God to save
      us. If He does not,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;at the worst I can always save myself,&rdquo;
       and she touched the pistol which now she wore day and night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said Mr. Clifford, with a groan. &ldquo;Let us pray for deliverance
      from this hell and keep our hands clean of blood.&rdquo;

    <h3>
      JACOB MEYER SEES A SPIRIT
    </h3>
    <p>
      For a while they were silent, then Benita said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, is it not possible that we might escape, after all? Perhaps that
      stair on the rampart is not so completely blocked that we could not climb
      over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford, thinking of his stiff limbs and aching back, shook his head
      and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; Meyer has never let me near enough to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why do you not go to look? You know he sleeps till late now,
      because he is up all night. Take the glasses and examine the top of the
      wall from inside that old house near by. He will not see or hear you, but
      if I came near, he would know and wake up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like, love, I can try, but what are you going to do while I am
      away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall climb the pillar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, nothing of that sort. I shall not follow the example of Benita da
      Ferreira unless I am driven to it; I want to look, that is all. One can
      see far from that place, if there is anything to see. Perhaps the Matabele
      are gone now, we have heard nothing of them lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they dressed themselves, and as soon as the light was sufficiently
      strong, came out of the hut and parted, Mr. Clifford, rifle in hand,
      limping off towards the wall, and Benita going towards the great cone. She
      climbed it easily enough, and stood in the little cup-like depression on
      its dizzy peak, waiting for the sun to rise and disperse the mists which
      hung over the river and its banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now whatever may have been the exact ceremonial use to which the ancients
      put this pinnacle, without doubt it had something to do with sun-worship.
      This, indeed, was proved by the fact that, at any rate at this season of
      the year, the first rays of the risen orb struck full upon its point. Thus
      it came about that, as she stood there waiting, Benita of a sudden found
      herself suffused in light so vivid and intense that, clothed as she was in
      a dress which had once been white, it must have caused her to shine like a
      silver image. For several minutes, indeed, this golden spear of fire
      blinded her so that she could see nothing, but stood quite still, afraid
      to move, and waiting until, as the sun grew higher, its level rays passed
      over her. This they did presently, and plunging into the valley, began to
      drive away the fog. Now she looked down, along the line of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Matabele camp was invisible, for it lay in a hollow almost at the foot
      of the fortress. Beyond it, however, was a rising swell of ground; it may
      have been half a mile from where she stood, and on the crest of it she
      perceived what looked like a waggon tent with figures moving round it.
      They were shouting also, for through the silence of the African morn the
      sound of their voices floated up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the mist cleared off Benita saw that without doubt it was a waggon, for
      there stood the long row of oxen, also it had just been captured by the
      Matabele, for these were about it in numbers. At the moment, however, they
      appeared to be otherwise occupied, for they were pointing with their
      spears to the pillar on Bambatse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it occurred to Benita that, placed as she was in that fierce light
      with only the sky for background, she must be perfectly visible from the
      plain below, and that it might be her figure perched like an eagle between
      heaven and earth which excited their interest. Yes, and not theirs only,
      for now a white man appeared, who lifted what might have been a gun, or a
      telescope, towards her. She was sure from the red flannel shirt and the
      broad hat which he wore that he must be a white man, and oh! how her heart
      yearned towards him, whoever he might be! The sight of an angel from
      heaven could scarcely have been more welcome to Benita in her
      wretchedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet surely she must be dreaming. What should a white man and a waggon be
      doing in that place? And why had not the Matabele killed him at once? She
      could not tell, yet they appeared to have no murderous intentions, since
      they continued to gesticulate and talk whilst he stared upwards with the
      telescope, if it were a telescope. So things went on for a long time, for
      meanwhile the oxen were outspanned, until, indeed, more Matabele arrived,
      who led off the white man, apparently against his will, towards their
      camp, where he disappeared. Then there was nothing more to be seen. Benita
      descended the column.
    </p>
    <p>
      At its foot she met her father, who had come to seek her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he asked, noting her excited face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said or rather sobbed, &ldquo;there is a waggon with a white man
      below. I saw the Matabele capture him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am sorry for the poor devil,&rdquo; answered the father, &ldquo;for he is dead
      by now. But what could a white man have been doing here? Some hunter, I
      suppose, who has walked into a trap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The face of Benita fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoped,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that he might help us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As well might he hope that we could help him. He is gone, and there is an
      end. Well, peace to his soul, and we have our own troubles to think of. I
      have been to look at that wall, and it is useless to think of climbing it.
      If he had been a professional mason, Meyer could not have built it up
      better; no wonder that we have seen nothing more of the Molimo, for only a
      bird could reach us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was Mr. Meyer,&rdquo; asked Benita.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asleep in a blanket under a little shelter of boughs by the stair. At
      least, I thought so, though it was rather difficult to make him out in the
      shadow; at any rate, I saw his rifle set against a tree. Come, let us go
      to breakfast. No doubt he will turn up soon enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they went, and for the first time since the Sunday Benita ate a hearty
      meal of biscuits soaked in coffee. Although her father was so sure that by
      now he must have perished on the Matabele spears, the sight of the white
      man and his waggon had put new life into her, bringing her into touch with
      the world again. After all, might it not chance that he had escaped?
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while there had been no sign of Jacob Meyer. This, however, did
      not surprise them, for now he ate his meals alone, taking his food from a
      little general store, and cooking it over his own fire. When they had
      finished their breakfast Mr. Clifford remarked that they had no more
      drinking water left, and Benita said that she would go to fetch a pailful
      from the well in the cave. Her father suggested that he should accompany
      her, but she answered that it was not necessary as she was quite able to
      wind the chain by herself. So she went, carrying the bucket in one hand
      and a lamp in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she walked down the last of the zigzags leading to the cave, Benita
      stopped a moment thinking that she saw a light, and then went on, since on
      turning the corner there was nothing but darkness before her. Evidently
      she had been mistaken. She reached the well and hung the pail on to the
      great copper hook, wondering as she did so how many folk had done likewise
      in the far, far past, for the massive metal of that hook was worn quite
      thin with use. Then she let the roller run, and the sound of the
      travelling chain clanked dismally in that vaulted, empty place. At length
      the pail struck the water, and she began to wind up again, pausing at
      times to rest, for the distance was long and the chain heavy. The bucket
      appeared. Benita drew it to the side of the well, and lifted it from the
      hook, then took up her lamp to be gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling or seeing something, which she was not sure, she held the lamp
      above her head, and by its light perceived a figure standing between her
      and the entrance to the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she asked, whereon a soft voice answered out of the
      darkness, the voice of Jacob Meyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind standing still for a few minutes, Miss Clifford? I have some
      paper here and I wish to make a sketch. You do not know how beautiful you
      look with that light above your head illuminating the shadows and the
      thorn-crowned crucifix beyond. You know, whatever paths fortune may have
      led me into, by nature I am an artist, and never in my life have I seen
      such a picture. One day it will make me famous.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;How statue-like I see thee stand!
     The agate lamp within thy hand.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      That&rsquo;s what I should put under it; you know the lines, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Meyer, but I am afraid you will have to paint your picture from
      memory, as I cannot hold up this lamp any longer; my arm is aching
      already. I do not know how you came here, but as you have followed me
      perhaps you will be so kind as to carry this water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not follow you, Miss Clifford. Although you never saw me I entered
      the cave before you to take measurements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you take measurements in the dark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not in the dark. I put out my light when I caught sight of you,
      knowing that otherwise you would run away, and fate stood me in good
      stead. You came on, as I willed that you should do. Now let us talk. Miss
      Clifford, have you changed your mind? You know the time is up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never change my mind. Let me pass you, Mr. Meyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not until you have listened. You are very cruel to me, very cruel
      indeed. You do not understand that, rather than do you the slightest harm,
      I would die a hundred times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not ask you to die; I ask you to leave me alone&mdash;a much easier
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can I leave you alone when you are a part of me, when&mdash;I
      love you? There, the truth is out, and now say what you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita lifted the bucket of water; its weight seemed to steady her. Then
      she put it down again, since escape was impracticable; she must face the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to say, Mr. Meyer, except that <i>I</i> do not love <i>you</i>
      or any living man, and I never shall. I thank you for the compliment you
      have paid me, and there is an end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any living man,&rdquo; he repeated after her. &ldquo;That means you love a dead man&mdash;Seymour,
      he who was drowned. No wonder that I hated him when first my eyes fell on
      him years ago, long before you had come into our lives. Prescience, the
      sub-conscious self again. Well, what is the use of loving the dead, those
      who no longer have any existence, who have gone back into the clay out of
      which they were formed and are not, nor evermore shall be? You have but
      one life; turn, turn to the living, and make it happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not agree with you, Mr. Meyer. To me the dead are still living; one
      day I shall find them. Now let me go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not let you go. I will plead and wrestle with you as in the old
      fable my namesake of my own race wrestled with the angel, until at length
      you bless me. You despise me because I am a Jew, because I have had many
      adventures and not succeeded; because you think me mad. But I tell you
      that there is the seed of greatness in me. Give yourself to me and I will
      make you great, for now I know that it was you whom I needed to supply
      what is lacking in my nature. We will win the wealth, and together we will
      rule&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until a few days hence we starve or the Matabele make an end of us. No,
      Mr. Meyer, no,&rdquo; and she tried to push past him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stretched out his arms and stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have pleaded with you as man with woman. Now, as you
      refuse me and as you alone stand between me and madness, I will take
      another course. I am your master, your will is servant to my will; I bid
      you obey me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fixed his eyes upon hers, and Benita felt her strength begin to fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are my servant now, and to show it I shall kiss you on
      the lips; then I shall throw the sleep upon you, and you will tell me what
      I want to know. Afterwards we can be wed when it pleases me. Oh! do not
      think that your father will defend you, for if he interferes I shall kill
      that foolish old man, whom until now I have only spared for your sake.
      Remember that if you make me angry, I shall certainly kill him, and your
      father&rsquo;s blood will be on your head. Now I am going to kiss you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita lifted her hand to find the pistol at her waist. It fell back
      again; she had no strength; it was as though she were paralysed as a bird
      is paralysed by a snake so that it cannot open its wings and fly away, but
      sits there awaiting death. She was given over into the hands of this man
      whom she hated. Could Heaven allow such a thing? she wondered dimly, and
      all the while his lips drew nearer to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      They touched her own, and then, why or wherefore Benita never understood,
      the spell broke. All his power was gone, she was as she had been, a free
      woman, mistress of herself. Contemptuously she thrust the man aside, and,
      not even troubling to run, lifted her pail of water and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon she saw the light again, and joyfully extinguished her lamp. Indeed,
      the breast of Benita, which should have been so troubled after the scene
      through which she had passed, strangely enough was filled with happiness
      and peace. As that glorious sunlight had broken on her eyes, so had
      another light of freedom arisen in her soul. She was no longer afraid of
      Jacob Meyer; that coward kiss of his had struck off the shackles which
      bound her to him. Her mind had been subject to his mind, but now that his
      physical nature was brought into the play, his mental part had lost its
      hold upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she approached the hut she saw her father seated on a stone outside it,
      since the poor old man was now so weak and full of pain that he could not
      stand for very long, and seeing, remembered Meyer&rsquo;s threats against him.
      At the thought all her new-found happiness departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She might be safe; she felt sure that she was safe, but how about her
      father? If Meyer could not get his way probably he would be as good as his
      word, and kill him. She shivered at the thought, then, recovering herself,
      walked forward steadily with her bucket of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been a long while gone, my love,&rdquo; said Mr. Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father, Mr. Meyer was in the cave, and kept me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he get there, and what did he want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how he got there&mdash;crept in when we were not looking, I
      suppose. But as for what he wanted&mdash;listen, dear,&rdquo; and word for word
      she told him what had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she had finished, her father was almost choking with wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dirty Jew! The villain!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;I never dreamed that he would
      dare to attempt such an outrage. Well, thank Heaven! I can still hold a
      rifle, and when he comes out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;that man is mad. He is not responsible for his
      actions, and therefore, except in self-defence, you must not think of such
      a thing. As for what he said about you, I believe it was only an empty
      threat, and for me you need have no fear, his power over me is gone; it
      went like a flash when his lips touched me,&rdquo; and she rubbed her own as
      though to wipe away some stain. &ldquo;I am afraid of nothing more. I believe&mdash;yes,
      I believe the old Molimo was right, and that all will end well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she was speaking Benita heard a shuffling sound behind her, and turned
      to learn its cause. Then she saw a strange sight. Jacob Meyer was
      staggering towards them, dragging one foot after the other through the
      grass and stones. His face was ghastly pale, his jaw had dropped like that
      of a dead man, and his eyes were set wide open and full of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with you, man?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;have seen a ghost,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You did not come back
      into the cave, did you?&rdquo; he added, pointing at Benita, who shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ghost?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but my lamp went out, and then a light began to shine
      behind me. I turned, and on the steps of that crucifix I saw a woman
      kneeling. Her arms clasped the feet of the figure, her forehead rested
      upon the feet, her long black hair flowed down, she was dressed in white,
      and the light came from her body and her head. Very slowly she turned and
      looked at me, and oh, Heaven! that face&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and he put his hand
      before his eyes and groaned. &ldquo;It was beautiful; yes, yes, but fearful to
      see, like an avenging angel. I fled, and the light&mdash;only the light&mdash;came
      with me down the cave, even at the mouth of it there was a little. I have
      seen a spirit, I who did not believe in spirits, I have seen a spirit, and
      I tell you that not for all the gold in the world will I enter that place
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then before they could answer, suddenly as though his fear had got some
      fresh hold of him, Jacob sprang forward and fled away, crashing through
      the bushes and leaping from rock to rock like a frightened buck.

    <h3>
      THE MESSAGE FROM THE DEAD
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meyer always said that he did not believe in spirits,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
      Clifford reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he believes in them now,&rdquo; answered Benita with a little laugh.
      &ldquo;But, father, the poor man is mad, that is the fact of it, and we must pay
      no attention to what he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old Molimo and some of his people&mdash;Tamas, for instance&mdash;declared
      that they have seen the ghost of Benita da Ferreira. Are they mad also,
      Benita?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, father. Who can say? All these things are a mystery. All I
      do know is that I have never seen a ghost, and I doubt if I ever shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but when you were in that trance something that was not you spoke out
      of your mouth, which something said that it was your namesake, the other
      Benita. Well, as you say, we can&rsquo;t fathom these things, especially in a
      haunted kind of place like this, but the upshot of it is that I don&rsquo;t
      think we have much more to fear from Jacob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so sure, father. Mad people change their moods very suddenly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As it happened Benita was quite right. Towards suppertime Jacob Meyer
      reappeared, looking pale and shaken, but otherwise much as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a kind of fit this morning,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;the result of an
      hallucination which seized me when my light went out in that cave. I
      remember that I thought I had seen a ghost, whereas I know very well that
      no such thing exists. I was the victim of disappointment, anxieties, and
      other still stronger emotions,&rdquo; and he looked at Benita. &ldquo;Therefore,
      please forget anything I said or did, and&mdash;would you give me some
      supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita did so, and he ate in silence, with some heartiness. When he had
      finished his food, and swallowed two or three tots of squareface, he spoke
      again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come here, where I know I am not welcome, upon business,&rdquo; he said
      in a calm, matter-of-fact voice. &ldquo;I am tired of this place, and I think it
      is time that we attained the object of our journey here, namely, to find
      the hidden gold. That, as we all know, can only be done in a certain way,
      through the clairvoyant powers of one of us and the hypnotic powers of
      another. Miss Clifford, I request that you will allow me to throw you into
      a state of trance. You have told us everything else, but you have not yet
      told us where the treasure is hidden, and this it is necessary that we
      should know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I refuse, Mr. Meyer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am sorry, but I must take means to compel your obedience. Under
      those circumstances, much against my will, I shall be obliged&rdquo;&mdash;here
      his eye blazed out wildly&mdash;&ldquo;to execute your father, whose obstinacy
      and influence stand between us and splendid fortunes. No, Clifford,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t stretch out your hand towards that rifle, for I am already
      covering you with the pistol in my pocket, and the moment your hand
      touches it I shall fire. You poor old man, do you imagine for a single
      second that, sick as you are, and with your stiff limbs, you can hope to
      match yourself against my agility, intellect, and strength? Why, I could
      kill you in a dozen ways before you could lift a finger against me, and by
      the God I do not believe in, unless your daughter is more compliant, kill
      you I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That remains to be seen, my friend,&rdquo; said Mr. Clifford with a laugh, for
      he was a brave old man. &ldquo;I am not certain that the God&mdash;whom you do
      not believe in&mdash;will not kill you first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Benita, who had been taking counsel with herself, looked up and said
      suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mr. Meyer, I consent&mdash;because I must. To-morrow morning
      you shall try to mesmerize me, if you can, in the same place, before the
      crucifix in the cave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered quickly. &ldquo;It was not there, it was here, and here it
      shall be again. The spot you mention is unpropitious to me; the attempt
      would fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the spot that I have chosen,&rdquo; answered Benita stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is the spot that I have chosen, Miss Clifford, and my will must
      prevail over yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you who do not believe in spirits are afraid to re-enter the
      cave, Mr. Meyer, lest you should chance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind what I am or am not afraid of,&rdquo; he replied with fury. &ldquo;Make
      your choice between doing my will and your father&rsquo;s life. To-morrow
      morning I shall come for your answer, and if you are still obstinate,
      within half an hour he will be dead, leaving you and me alone together.
      Oh! you may call me wicked and a villain, but it is you who are wicked,
      you, you, <i>you</i> who force me to this deed of justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then without another word he sprang up and walked away from them
      backwards, as he went covering Mr. Clifford with the pistol which he had
      drawn from his pocket. The last that they saw of him were his eyes, which
      glowered at them through the darkness like those of a lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Benita, when she was sure that he had gone, &ldquo;that madman
      really means to murder you; there is no doubt of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever, dear; if I am alive to-morrow night I shall be lucky,
      unless I can kill him first or get out of his way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said hurriedly, &ldquo;I think you can. I have an idea. He is afraid
      to go into that cave, I am sure. Let us hide ourselves there. We can take
      food and shall have plenty of water, whereas, unless rain falls, he can
      get nothing to drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what then, Benita? We can&rsquo;t stop in the dark for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but we can wait there until something happens. Something must and
      will happen. His disease won&rsquo;t stand still. He may go raving mad and kill
      himself. Or he may attempt to attack us, though that is not likely, and
      then we must do what we can in self defence. Or help may reach us from
      somewhere. At the worst we shall only die as we should have died outside.
      Come, let us be quick, lest he should change his mind, and creep back upon
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Mr. Clifford gave way, knowing that even if he could steel himself to
      do the deed of attempting to kill Jacob, he would have little chance
      against that strong and agile man. Such a struggle would only end in his
      own death, and Benita must then be left alone with Meyer and his insane
      passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurriedly they carried their few belongings into the cave. First they took
      most of the little store of food that remained, the three hand-lamps and
      all the paraffin; there was but one tin. Then returning they fetched the
      bucket, the ammunition, and their clothes. Afterwards, as there was still
      no sign of Meyer, they even dared to drag in the waggon tent to make a
      shelter for Benita, and all the wood that they had collected for firing.
      This proved a wearisome business, for the logs were heavy, and in his
      crippled state Mr. Clifford could carry no great burden. Indeed, towards
      the end Benita was forced to complete the task alone, while he limped
      beside her with his rifle, lest Jacob should surprise them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at length everything was done it was long past midnight, and so
      exhausted were they that, notwithstanding their danger, they flung
      themselves down upon the canvas tent, which lay in a heap at the end of
      the cave near the crucifix, and fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Benita woke the lamp had gone out, and it was pitch dark.
      Fortunately, however, she remembered where she had put the matches and the
      lantern with a candle in it. She lit the candle and looked at her watch.
      It was nearly six o&rsquo;clock. The dawn must be breaking outside, within an
      hour or two Jacob Meyer would find that they had gone. Suppose that his
      rage should overcome his fear and that he should creep upon them. They
      would know nothing of it until his face appeared in the faint ring of
      light. Or he might even shoot her father out of the darkness. What could
      she do that would give them warning? A thought came to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking one of the tent ropes and the lantern, for her father still slept
      heavily, she went down to the entrance of the cave, and at the end of the
      last zigzag where once a door had been, managed to make it fast to a stone
      hinge about eighteen inches above the floor, and on the other side to an
      eye opposite that was cut in the solid rock to receive a bolt of wood or
      iron. Meyer, she knew, had no lamps or oil, only matches and perhaps a few
      candles. Therefore if he tried to enter the cave it was probable that he
      would trip over the rope and thus give them warning. Then she went back,
      washed her face and hands with some water that they had drawn on the
      previous night to satisfy their thirst, and tidied herself as best she
      could. This done, as her father still slept, she filled the lamps, lit one
      of them, and looked about her, for she was loth to wake him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly it was an awful place in which to dwell. There above them towered
      the great white crucifix; there in the corner were piled the remains of
      the Portuguese. A skull with long hair still hanging to it grinned at her,
      a withered hand was thrust forward as though to clutch her. Oh, no wonder
      that in such a spot Jacob Meyer had seen ghosts! In front, too, was the
      yawning grave where they had found the monk; indeed, his bones wrapped in
      dark robes still lay within, for Jacob had tumbled them back again. Then
      beyond and all around deep, dark, and utter silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last her father woke, and glad enough was she of his human company.
      They breakfasted upon some biscuits and water, and afterwards, while Mr.
      Clifford watched near the entrance with his rifle, Benita set to work to
      arrange their belongings. The tent she managed to prop up against the wall
      of the cave by help of some of the wood which they had carried in. Beneath
      it she spread their blankets, that it might serve as a sleeping place for
      them both, and outside placed the food and other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was thus engaged she heard a sound at the mouth of the cave&mdash;Jacob
      Meyer was entering and had fallen over her rope. Down it she ran, lantern
      in hand, to her father, who, with his rifle raised, was shouting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you come in here, I put a bullet through you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came the answer in Jacob&rsquo;s voice, which rang hollow in that vaulted
      place:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not want to come in; I shall wait for you to come out. You cannot
      live long in there; the horror of the dark will kill you. I have only to
      sit in the sunlight and wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he laughed, and they heard the sound of his footsteps retreating down
      the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clifford despairingly. &ldquo;We cannot live
      without light, and if we have light he will certainly creep to the
      entrance and shoot us. He is quite mad now; I am sure of it from his
      voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita thought a minute, then she answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must build up the passage. Look,&rdquo; and she pointed to the lumps of rock
      that the explosion of their mine had shaken down from the roof, and the
      slabs of cement that they had broken from the floor with the crowbar. &ldquo;At
      once, at once,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;he will not come back for some hours,
      probably not till night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they set to work, and never did Benita labour as it was her lot to do
      that day. Such of the fragments as they could lift they carried between
      them, others they rolled along by help of the crowbar. For hour after hour
      they toiled at their task. Luckily for them, the passage was not more than
      three feet wide by six feet six high, and their material was ample. Before
      the evening they had blocked it completely with a wall several feet in
      thickness, which wall they supported on the inside with lengths of the
      firewood lashed across to the old hinges and bolt-holes, or set obliquely
      against its face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was done, and they regarded their work with pride, although it seemed
      probable that they were building up their own tomb. Because of its
      position at an angle of the passage, they knew that Meyer could not get to
      it with a pole to batter it down. Also, there was no loose powder left, so
      his only chance would be to pull it to pieces with his hands, and this,
      they thought, might be beyond his power. At least, should he attempt it,
      they would have ample warning. Yet that day was not to pass without
      another trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as they had rolled up and levered into place a long fragment of rock
      designed to prevent the ends of their supporting pieces of wood from
      slipping on the cement floor, Mr. Clifford uttered an exclamation, then
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have wrung my back badly. Help me to the tent. I must lie down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and with great pain they staggered up the cave, Mr. Clifford
      leaning on Benita and a stick, till, reaching the tent at last, he almost
      fell on to the blankets and remained there practically crippled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now began Benita&rsquo;s terrible time, the worst of all her life. Every hour
      her father became more ill. Even before they took refuge in the cave he
      was completely broken down, and now after this accident he began to suffer
      very much. His rheumatism or sciatica, or whatever it was, seemed to
      settle upon the hurt muscles of his back, causing him so much pain that he
      could scarcely sleep for ten minutes at a stretch. Moreover, he would
      swallow but little of the rough food which was all Benita was able to
      prepare for him; nothing, indeed, except biscuit soaked in black coffee,
      which she boiled over a small fire made of wood that they had brought with
      them, and occasionally a little broth, tasteless stuff enough, for it was
      only the essence of biltong, or sun-dried flesh, flavoured with some salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there were two other terrors against she must fight, the darkness and
      the dread of Jacob Meyer. Perhaps the darkness was the worse of them. To
      live in that hideous gloom in which their single lamp, for she dared burn
      no more lest the oil should give out, seemed but as one star to the whole
      night, ah! who that had not endured it could know what it meant? There the
      sick man, yonder the grinning skeletons, around the blackness and the
      silence, and beyond these again a miserable death, or Jacob Meyer. But of
      him Benita saw nothing, though once or twice she thought that she heard
      his voice raving outside the wall which they had built. If so, either he
      did not try to pull it down, or he failed in the attempt, or perhaps he
      feared that should he succeed, he would be greeted by a bullet. So at last
      she gave up thinking about him. Should he force his way into the cave she
      must deal with the situation as best she could. Meanwhile, her father&rsquo;s
      strength was sinking fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three awful days went by in this fashion, and the end drew near. Although
      she tried to force herself to it, Benita could not swallow enough food to
      keep up her strength. Now that the passage was closed the atmosphere of
      this old vault, for it was nothing more, thickened by the smoke of the
      fire which she was obliged to burn, grew poisonous and choked her. Want of
      sleep exhausted her, dread of what the morrow might bring forth crushed
      her strong spirit. She began to break down, knowing that the hour was near
      when she and her father must die together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, as she slept awhile at his side, being wakened by his groaning,
      Benita looked at her watch. It was midnight. She rose, and going to the
      embers of the little fire, warmed up some of her biltong broth which she
      poured into a tin pannikin. With difficulty she forced him to swallow a
      few mouthfuls of it, then, feeling a sudden weakness, drank the rest
      herself. It gave her power to think, and her father dozed off into an
      uneasy sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! thinking was of no use, nothing could be done. There was no hope
      save in prayer. Restlessness seized Benita, and taking the lantern she
      wandered round the cave. The wall that they had built remained intact, and
      oh! to think that beyond it flowed the free air and shone the blessed
      stars! Back she came again, skirting the pits that Jacob Meyer had dug,
      and the grave of the old monk, till she reached the steps of the crucifix,
      and holding up her candle, looked at the thorn-crowned brow of the Christ
      above.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was wonderfully carved; that dying face was full of pity. Would not He
      Whom it represented pity her? She knelt down on the topmost step, and
      clasping the pierced feet with her arms, began to pray earnestly, not for
      herself but that she might save her father. She prayed as she had never
      prayed before, and so praying, sank into a torpor or a swoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Benita that this sleep of hers suddenly became alive; in it
      she saw many things. For instance, she saw herself seated in a state of
      trance upon that very step where now she knelt, while before her stood her
      father and Jacob Meyer. Moreover, something spoke in her; she could not
      hear a voice, but she seemed to see the words written in the air before
      her. These were the words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Clasp the feet of the Christ and draw them to the left. The passage
      beneath leads to the chamber where the gold is hid, and thence to the
      river bank. That is the secret which ere I depart, I the dead Benita, pass
      on to you, the living Benita, as I am commanded. In life and death peace
      be to your soul.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thrice did this message appear to repeat itself in the consciousness of
      Benita. Then, suddenly as she had slept, she woke again with every letter
      of it imprinted on her mind. Doubtless it was a dream, nothing but a dream
      bred by the fact that her arms were clasping the feet of the crucifix.
      What did it say? &ldquo;Draw them to the left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did so, but nothing stirred. Again she tried, and still nothing
      stirred. Of course it was a dream. Why had such been sent to mock her? In
      a kind of mad irritation she put out all her remaining strength and
      wrestled with those stony feet. <i>They moved a little</i>&mdash;then of a
      sudden, without any further effort on her part, swung round as high as the
      knees where drapery hung, concealing the join in them. Yes, they swung
      round, revealing the head of a stair, up which blew a cold wind that it
      was sweet to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benita rose, gasping. Then she seized her lantern and ran to the little
      tent where her father lay.

    <h3>
      THE VOICE OF THE LIVING
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford was awake again now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; he asked querulously in a thin voice. &ldquo;I wanted
      you.&rdquo; Then as the light from the candle shone upon it, he noted the change
      that had come over her pale face, and added: &ldquo;What has happened? Is Meyer
      dead? Are we free?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita shook her head. &ldquo;He was alive a few hours ago, for I could hear him
      raving and shouting outside the wall we built. But, father, it has all
      come back to me; I believe that I have found it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has come back? What have you found? Are you mad, too, like Jacob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What something told me when I was in the trance which afterwards I
      forgot, but now remember. And I have found the passage which leads to
      where they hid the gold. It begins behind the crucifix, where no one ever
      thought of looking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This matter of the gold did not seem to interest Mr. Clifford. In his
      state all the wealth beneath the soil of Africa would not have appealed to
      him. Moreover, he hated the name of that accursed treasure, which was
      bringing them to such a miserable end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does the passage run? Have you looked?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, but the voice in me said&mdash;I mean, I dreamed&mdash;that it
      goes down to the river-side. If you leant on me do you think that you
      could walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one inch,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Here where I am I shall die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t talk like that. We may be saved now that I have found a
      way. Oh, if only you could&mdash;if only you could walk, or if I had the
      strength to carry you!&rdquo; and she wrung her hands and began to weep, so weak
      was she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father looked at her searchingly. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, love, I cannot, so there&rsquo;s an end. But you can, and you had better
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! And leave you? Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and leave me. Look, there is but a little oil left and only a few
      candles. The biscuits are done and neither of us can swallow that biltong
      any more. I suppose that I am dying, and your health and strength are
      failing you quickly in this darkness; if you stop here you must soon
      follow me. And what is the alternative? The madman outside&mdash;that is,
      if you could find strength to pull down the wall, which I doubt. You had
      best go, Benita.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But still she said she would not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not see,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that it is my only chance of life? If you go
      you may be able to bring me help before the end comes. Should there be a
      passage the probability is that, although they know nothing of it, it
      finishes somewhere by the wall of the first enclosure where the Makalanga
      are. If so, you may find the Molimo, or if he is dead, Tamas or one of the
      others, and they will help us. Go, Benita, go at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought of that,&rdquo; she answered in a changed voice. &ldquo;Of course, it
      may be so, if the passage goes down at all. Well, at least I can look and
      come back to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Benita placed the remainder of the oil close by her father&rsquo;s side, so
      that he could refill the lamp, for the use of his hands still remained to
      him. Also, she set there such crumbs of biscuit as were left, some of the
      biltong, a flask of Hollands, and a pail of water. This done, she put on
      her long cloak, filled one of its pockets with biltong, and the other with
      matches and three of the four remaining candles. The fourth she insisted
      on leaving beside her father&rsquo;s bed. When everything was ready she knelt
      down at his side, kissed him, and from her heart put up a prayer that they
      might both live to meet again, although she knew well that this they could
      scarcely hope to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had two people ever been in a more dreadful situation, she wondered, as
      she looked at her father lying there, whom she must leave to fight with
      Death alone in that awful place, while she went forth to meet him in the
      unknown bowels of the earth!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford read her thoughts. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is a strange parting
      and a wild errand. But who knows? It may please Providence to take you
      through, and if not&mdash;why, our troubles will soon be over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then once more they kissed, and not daring to try to speak, Benita tore
      herself away. Passing into the passage whereof the lower half of the
      crucifix formed the door, she paused for a moment to examine it and to
      place a fragment of rock in such fashion that it could not shut again
      behind her. Her idea was that it worked by aid of some spring, but now she
      saw that this was not so, as the whole mass hung upon three stone hinges
      beautifully concealed. The dust and corrosion of ages which had made this
      door so hard to open, by filling up the tiny spaces between it and its
      framework, had also rendered these cracks utterly imperceptible to the
      eye. So accurately was it fashioned, indeed, that no one who did not know
      its secret would have discovered it if they searched for months or years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though at the time Benita took little note of such details, the passage
      beyond and the stair descending from it showed the same perfect
      workmanship. Evidently this secret way dated not from the Portuguese
      period, but from that of the Phoenicians or other ancients, to whose
      treasure-chamber it was the approach, opening as it did from their holy of
      holies, to which none were admitted save the head priests. The passage,
      which was about seven feet high by four wide, had been hewn out of the
      live rock of the mountain, for thousands of little marks left by the
      workmen&rsquo;s chisels were still discernible upon its walls. So it was with
      the stair, that had been but little used, and remained fresh as the day
      when it was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the steps, candle in hand, flitted Benita, counting them as she went.
      The thirtieth brought her to a landing. Here it was that she saw the first
      traces of that treasure which they had suffered so much to find. Something
      glittered at her feet. She picked it up. It was a little bar of gold
      weighing two or three ounces that doubtless had been dropped there.
      Throwing it down again she looked in front of her, and to her dismay saw a
      door of wood with iron bolts. But the bolts had never been shot, and when
      she pulled at it the door creaked upon its rusty hinges and opened. She
      was on the threshold of the treasure-chamber!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was square and of the size of a small room, packed on either side
      almost to the low, vaulted roof with small bags of raw hide, carelessly
      arranged. Quite near to the door one of these bags had slipped down and
      burst open. It was filled with gold, some in ingots and some in raw
      nuggets, for there they lay in a shining, scattered heap. As she stooped
      to look it came into the mind of Benita that her father had said that in
      her trance she had told them that one of the bags of treasure was burst,
      and that the skin of which it had been made was black and red. Behold!
      before her lay the burst bag, and the colour of the hide was black and
      red.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shivered. The thing was uncanny, terrible. Uncanny was it also to see
      in the thick dust, which in the course of twenty or more of centuries had
      gathered on the floor, the mark of footprints, those of the last persons
      who had visited this place. There had been two of them, a man and a woman,
      and they were no savages, for they wore shoes. Benita placed her foot in
      the print left by that dead woman. It filled it exactly, it might have
      been her own. Perhaps, she thought to herself, that other Benita had
      descended here with her father, after the Portuguese had hidden away their
      wealth, that she might be shown where it was, and of what it consisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      One more glance at all this priceless, misery-working gold, and on she
      went, she who was seeking the gold of life and liberty for herself and him
      who lay above. Supposing that the stairway ended there? She stopped, she
      looked round, but could see no other door. To see the better she halted
      and opened the glass of her lantern. Still she could perceive nothing, and
      her heart sank. Yet why did the candle flicker so fiercely? And why was
      the air in this deep place so fresh? She walked forward a pace or two,
      then noticed suddenly that those footprints of the dead that she was
      following disappeared immediately in front of her, and she stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but just in time. One step more and she would have fallen down the
      mouth of a deep pit. Once it had been covered with a stone, but this stone
      was removed, and had never been replaced. Look! there it stood against the
      wall of the chamber. Well was this for Benita, since her frail strength
      would not have sufficed to stir that massive block, even if she had
      discovered its existence beneath the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she saw that down the pit ran another ladderlike stair of stone, very
      narrow and precipitous. Without hesitation she began its descent. Down she
      went and down&mdash;one hundred steps, two hundred steps, two hundred and
      seventy-five steps, and all the way wherever the dust had gathered the
      man&rsquo;s and the woman&rsquo;s footprints ran before her. There was a double line
      of them, one line going down and the other line returning. Those that
      returned were the last, for often they appeared over those that descended.
      Why had these dead people returned, Benita wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stair had ended; now she was in a kind of natural cave, for its sides
      and roof were rugged; moreover, water trickled and dripped from them. It
      was not very large, and it smelt horribly of mud and other things. Again
      she searched by the feeble light of her candle, but could see no exit.
      Suddenly she saw something else, however, for stepping on what she took to
      be a rock, to her horror it moved beneath her. She heard a snap as of
      jaws, a violent blow upon the leg nearly knocked her off her feet, and as
      she staggered backwards she saw a huge and loathsome shape rushing away
      into the darkness. The rock that she had trodden on was a crocodile which
      had its den here! With a little scream she retreated to her stair. Death
      she had expected&mdash;but to be eaten by crocodiles!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet as Benita stood there panting a blessed hope rose in her breast. If a
      crocodile came in there it must also get out, and where such a great
      creature could go, a woman would be able to follow. Also, she must be near
      the water, since otherwise it could never have chosen this hole for its
      habitation. She collected her courage, and having clapped her hands and
      waved the lantern about to scare any alligators that might still be
      lurking there, hearing and seeing nothing more, she descended to where she
      had trodden upon the reptile. Evidently this was its bed, for its long
      body had left an impress upon the mud, and all about lay the remains of
      creatures that it had brought in for food. Moreover, a path ran outwards,
      its well-worn trail distinct even in that light.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed this path, which ended apparently in a blank wall. Then it
      was that Benita guessed why those dead folks&rsquo; footprints had returned, for
      here had been a doorway which in some past age those who used it built up
      with blocks of stone and cement. How, then, did the crocodile get out?
      Stooping down she searched, and perceived, a few yards to the right of the
      door, a hole that looked as though it were water-worn. Now Benita thought
      that she understood. The rock was softer here, and centuries of flood had
      eaten it away, leaving a crack in the stratum which the crocodiles had
      found out and enlarged. Down she went on her hands and knees, and
      thrusting the lantern in front of her, crept along that noisome drain, for
      this was what it resembled. And now&mdash;oh! now she felt air blowing in
      her face, and heard the sound of reeds whispering, and water running, and
      saw hanging like a lamp in the blue sky, a star&mdash;the morning star!
      Benita could have wept, she could have worshipped it, yet she pushed on
      between rocks till she found herself among tall reeds, and standing in
      water. She had gained the banks of the Zambesi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly, by instinct as it were, Benita extinguished her candle, fearing
      lest it should betray her, for constant danger had made her very cunning.
      The dawn had not yet broken, but the waning moon and the stars gave a good
      light. She paused to look. There above her towered the outermost wall of
      Bambatse, against which the river washed, except at such times as the
      present, when it was very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she was not in the fortress as she had hoped, but without it, and oh!
      what should she do? Go back again? How would that serve her father or
      herself? Go on? Then she might fall into the hands of the Matabele whose
      camp was a little lower down, as from her perch upon the top of the cone
      she had seen that poor white man do. Ah! the white man! If only he lived
      and she could reach him! Perhaps they had not killed him after all. It was
      madness, yet she would try to discover; something impelled her to take the
      risk. If she failed and escaped, perhaps then she might call to the
      Makalanga, and they would let down a rope and draw her up the wall before
      the Matabele caught her. She would not go back empty-handed, to die in
      that dreadful place with her poor father. Better perish here in the sweet
      air and beneath the stars, even if it were upon a Matabele spear, or by a
      bullet from her own pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked about her to take her bearings in case it should ever be
      necessary for her to return to the entrance of the cave. This proved easy,
      for a hundred or so feet above her&mdash;where the sheer face of the cliff
      jutted out a little, at that very spot indeed on which tradition said that
      the body of the Señora da Ferreira had struck in its fall, and the
      necklace Benita wore to-day was torn from her&mdash;a stunted mimosa grew
      in some cleft of the rock. To mark the crocodile run itself she bent down
      a bunch of reeds, and having first lit a few Tandstickor brimstone matches
      and thrown them about inside of it, that the smell of them might scare the
      beast should it wish to return, she set her lantern behind a stone near to
      the mouth of the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Benita began her journey which, when the river was high, it would not
      have been possible for her to make except by swimming. As it was, a margin
      of marsh was left between her and the steep, rocky side of the mount from
      which the great wall rose, and through this she made her way. Never was
      she likely to forget that walk. The tall reeds dripped their dew upon her
      until she was soaked; long, black-tailed finches&mdash;saccaboolas the
      natives call them&mdash;flew up undisturbed, and lobbed away across the
      river; owls flitted past and bitterns boomed at the coming of the dawn.
      Great fish splashed also in the shallows, or were they crocodiles? Benita
      hoped not&mdash;for one day she had seen enough of crocodiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all very strange. Could she be the same woman, she wondered, who
      not a year before had been walking with her cousins down Westbourne Grove,
      and studying Whiteley&rsquo;s windows? What would these cousins say now if they
      could see her, white-faced, large-eyed, desperate, splashing through the
      mud upon the unknown banks of the Zambesi, flying from death to death!
    </p>
    <p>
      On she struggled, above her the pearly sky in which the stars were fading,
      around her the wet reeds, and pervading all the heavy low-lying mists of
      dawn. She was past the round of the walls, and at length stood upon dry
      ground where the Matabele had made their camp. But in that fog she saw no
      Matabele; probably their fires were out, and she chanced to pass between
      the sentries. Instinctively, more than by reason, she headed for that
      hillock upon which she had seen the white man&rsquo;s waggon, in the vague hope
      that it might still be there. On she struggled, still on, till at length
      she blundered against something soft and warm, and perceived that it was
      an ox tied to a trek-tow, beyond which were other oxen and a white
      waggon-cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it <i>was</i> still there! But the white man, where was he? Through the
      dense mist Benita crept to the disselboom. Then, seeing and hearing
      nothing, she climbed to the voorkissie and kneeling on it, separated the
      tent flaps and peered into the waggon. Still she could see nothing because
      of the mist, yet she heard something, a man breathing in his sleep.
      Somehow she thought that it was a white man; a Kaffir did not breathe like
      that. She did not know what to do, so remained kneeling there. It seemed
      as though the man who was asleep began to feel her presence, for he
      muttered to himself&mdash;surely the words were English! Then quite
      suddenly he struck a match and lit a candle which stood in a beer bottle
      by his side. She could not see his face while he lit the match, for his
      arm hid it, and the candle burned up slowly. Then the first thing she saw
      was the barrel of a revolver pointing straight at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my black friend,&rdquo; said a pleasant voice, &ldquo;down you go or I shoot.
      One, two! Oh, my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The candle burned up, its light fell upon the white, elfish face of
      Benita, whose long dark hair streamed about her; it shone in her great
      eyes. Still she could see nothing, for it dazzled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; said the voice again. &ldquo;Benita! Benita! Have you come to tell
      me that I must join you? Well, I am ready, my sweet, my sweet! Now I shall
      hear your answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she whispered, and crawling forward down the cartel Benita fell
      upon his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      For she knew him at last&mdash;dead or living she cared not&mdash;she knew
      him, and out of hell crept to him, her heaven and her home!

    <h3>
      BENITA GIVES HER ANSWER
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your answer, Benita,&rdquo; Robert said dreamily, for to him this thing seemed
      a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not given it, months ago? Oh, I remember, it was only in my heart,
      not on my lips, when that blow fell on me! Then afterwards I heard what
      you had done and I nearly died. I wished that I might die to be with you,
      but I could not. I was too strong; now I understand the reason. Well, it
      seems that we are both living, and whatever happens, here is my answer, if
      it is worth anything to you. Once and for all, I love you. I am not
      ashamed to say it, because very soon we may be separated for the last
      time. But I cannot talk now, I have come here to save my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he, Benita?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dying in a cave up at the top of that fortress. I got down by a secret
      way. Are the Matabele still here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much so,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But something has happened. My guard woke me
      an hour ago to say that a messenger had arrived from their king,
      Lobengula, and now they are talking over the message. That is how you came
      to get through, otherwise the sentries would have assegaied you, the
      brutes,&rdquo; and he drew her to him and kissed her passionately for the first
      time; then, as though ashamed of himself, let her go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything to eat?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;am starving. I
      didn&rsquo;t feel it before, but now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Starving, you starving, while I&mdash;look, here is some cold meat which
      I could not get down last night, and put by for the Kaffirs. Great
      Heavens! that I should feed you with Kaffirs&rsquo; leavings! But it is good&mdash;eat
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita took the stuff in her fingers and swallowed it greedily; she who
      for days had lived on nothing but a little biscuit and biltong. It tasted
      delicious to her&mdash;never had she eaten anything so good. And all the
      while he watched her with glowing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you look at me?&rdquo; she said at length. &ldquo;I must be horrible; I have
      been living in the dark and crawling through mud. I trod upon a
      crocodile!&rdquo; and she shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever you are I never want to see you different,&rdquo; he answered slowly.
      &ldquo;To me you are most beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even then, wreck as she was, the poor girl flushed, and there was a mist
      in her eyes as she looked up and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I don&rsquo;t care now what happens to me, and what has happened
      doesn&rsquo;t matter at all. But can we get away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but I doubt it. Go and sit on the waggon-box
      for a few minutes while I dress, and we will see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita went. The mist was thinning now, and through it she saw a sight at
      which her heart sank, for between her and the mount Bambatse Matabele were
      pouring towards their camp on the river&rsquo;s edge. They were cut off. A
      couple of minutes later Robert joined her, and as he came she looked at
      him anxiously in the growing light. He seemed older than when they had
      parted on the <i>Zanzibar</i>; changed, too, for now his face was serious,
      and he had grown a beard; also, he appeared to limp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid there is an end,&rdquo; she said, pointing to the Matabele below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it looks like it. But like you, I say, what does it matter now?&rdquo; and
      he took her hand in his, adding: &ldquo;let us be happy while we can if only for
      a few minutes. They will be here presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;A prisoner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. I was following you when they captured me; for I have been
      here before and knew the way. They were going to kill me on general
      principles, only it occurred to one of them who was more intelligent than
      the rest that I, being a white man, might be able to show them how to
      storm the place. Now I was sure that you were there, for I saw you
      standing on that point, though they thought you were the Spirit of
      Bambatse. So I wasn&rsquo;t anxious to help them, for then&mdash;you know what
      happens when the Matabele are the stormers! But&mdash;as you still lived&mdash;I
      wasn&rsquo;t anxious to die either. So I set them to work to dig a hole with
      their assegais and sharp axes, through granite. They have completed
      exactly twenty feet of it, and I reckon that there are one hundred and
      forty to go. Last night they got tired of that tunnel and talked of
      killing me again, unless I could show them a better plan. Now all the fat
      is in the fire, and I don&rsquo;t know what is to happen. Hullo! here they come.
      Hide in the waggon, quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita obeyed, and from under cover of the tent where the Matabele could
      not see her, watched and listened. The party that approached consisted of
      a chief and about twenty men, who marched behind him as a guard. Benita
      knew that chief. He was the captain Maduna, he of the royal blood whose
      life she had saved. By his side was a Natal Zulu, Robert Seymour&rsquo;s driver,
      who could speak English and acted as interpreter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White man,&rdquo; said Maduna, &ldquo;a message has reached us from our king.
      Lobengula makes a great war and has need of us. He summons us back from
      this petty fray, this fight against cowards who hide behind walls, whom
      otherwise we would have killed, everyone, yes, if we sat here till we grew
      old. So for this time we leave them alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robert answered politely that he was glad to hear it, and wished them a
      good journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish yourself a good journey, white man,&rdquo; was the stern reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Do you desire that I should accompany you to Lobengula?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you go before us to the kraal of the Black One who is even greater
      than the child of Moselikatse, to that king who is called Death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robert crossed his arms and said: &ldquo;Say on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White man, I promised you life if you would show us how to pierce or
      climb those walls. But you have made fools of us&mdash;you have set us to
      cut through rock with spears and axes. Yes, to hoe at rock as though it
      were soil&mdash;you who with the wisdom of your people could have taught
      us some better way. Therefore we must go back to our king disgraced,
      having failed in his service, and therefore you who have mocked us shall
      die. Come down now, that we may kill you quietly, and learn whether or no
      you are a brave man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then it was, while her lover&rsquo;s hand was moving towards the pistol hidden
      beneath his coat, that Benita, with a quick movement, emerged from the
      waggon in which she crouched, and stood up at his side upon the driving
      box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ow!</i>&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;It is the White Maiden. Now how came she
      here? Surely this is great magic. Can a woman fly like a bird?&rdquo; and they
      stared at her amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it matter how I came, chief Maduna?&rdquo; she answered in Zulu. &ldquo;Yet
      I will tell you why I came. It was to save you from dipping your spear in
      the innocent blood, and bringing on your head the curse of the innocent
      blood. Answer me now. Who gave you and your brother yonder your lives
      within that wall when the Makalanga would have torn you limb from limb, as
      hyenas tear a buck? Was it I or another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inkosi-kaas&mdash;Chieftainess,&rdquo; replied the great Captain, raising his
      broad spear in salute. &ldquo;It was you and no other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you promise me then, Prince Maduna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maiden of high birth, I promised you your life and your goods, should you
      ever fall into my power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does a leader of the Amandabele, one of the royal blood, lie like a
      Mashona or a Makalanga slave? Does he do worse&mdash;tell half the truth
      only, like a cheat who buys and keeps back half the price?&rdquo; she asked
      contemptuously. &ldquo;Maduna, you promised me not one life, but two, two lives
      and the goods that belong to both. Ask of your brother there, who was
      witness of the words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heavens!&rdquo; muttered Robert Seymour to himself, as he looked at
      Benita standing with outstretched hand and flashing eyes. &ldquo;Who would have
      thought that a starved woman could play such a part with death on the
      hazard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as this daughter of white chiefs says,&rdquo; answered the man to whom
      she had appealed. &ldquo;When she freed us from the fangs of those dogs, you
      promised her two lives, my brother, one for yours and one for mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear him,&rdquo; went on Benita. &ldquo;He promised me two lives, and how did this
      prince of the royal blood keep his promise? When I and the old man, my
      father, rode hence in peace, he loosed his spears upon us; he hunted us.
      Yet it was the hunters who fell into the trap, not the hunted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maiden,&rdquo; replied Maduna, in a shamed voice, &ldquo;that was your fault, not
      mine. If you had appealed to me I would have let you go. But you killed my
      sentry, and then the chase began, and ere I knew who you were my runners
      were out of call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little time had I to ask your mercy; but so be it,&rdquo; said Benita. &ldquo;I
      accept your word, and I forgive you that offence. Now fulfil your oath.
      Begone and leave us in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Maduna hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must make report to the king,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What is this white man to you
      that I should spare him? I give you your life and your father&rsquo;s life, not
      that of this white man who has tricked us. If he were your father, or your
      brother, it would be otherwise. But he is a stranger, and belongs to me,
      not to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maduna,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;do women such as I am share the waggon of a
      stranger? This man is more to me than father or brother. He is my husband,
      and I claim his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ow!</i>&rdquo; said the spokesman of the audience, &ldquo;we understand now. She
      is his wife, and has a right to him. If she were not his wife she would
      not be in his waggon. It is plain that she speaks the truth, though how
      she came here we do not know, unless, as we think, she is a witch,&rdquo; and he
      smiled at his own cleverness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inkosi-kaas,&rdquo; said Maduna, &ldquo;you have persuaded me. I give you the life of
      that white fox, your husband, and I hope that he will not trick you as he
      has tricked us, and set you to hoe rock instead of soil,&rdquo; and he looked at
      Robert wrathfully. &ldquo;I give him to you and all his belongings. Now, is
      there anything else that you would ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Benita coolly, &ldquo;you have many oxen there which you took
      from the other Makalanga. Mine are eaten and I need cattle to draw my
      waggon. I ask a present of twenty of them, and,&rdquo; she added by an
      afterthought, &ldquo;two cows with young calves, for my father is sick yonder,
      and must have milk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! give them to her. Give them to her,&rdquo; said Maduna, with a tragic
      gesture that in any other circumstances would have made Benita laugh.
      &ldquo;Give them to her and see that they are good ones, before she asks our
      shields and spears also&mdash;for after all she saved my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So men departed to fetch those cows and oxen, which presently were driven
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this talk was in progress the great impi of the Matabele was massing
      for the march, on the flat ground a little to the right of them. Now they
      began to come past in companies, preceded by the lads who carried the mats
      and cooking-pots and drove the captured sheep and cattle. By this time the
      story of Benita, the witch-woman whom they could not kill, and who had
      mysteriously flown from the top of the peak into their prisoner&rsquo;s waggon,
      had spread among them. They knew also that it was she who had saved their
      general from the Makalanga, and those who had heard her admired the wit
      and courage with which she had pleaded and won her cause. Therefore, as
      they marched past in their companies, singing a song of abuse and defiance
      of the Makalanga who peered at them from the top of the wall, they lifted
      their great spears in salutation to Benita standing upon the waggon-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, they were a wondrous and imposing spectacle, such a one as few
      white women have ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length all were gone except Maduna and a body-guard of two hundred men.
      He walked to the front of the waggon and addressed Robert Seymour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, you fox who set us to hoe granite,&rdquo; he said indignantly. &ldquo;You
      have outwitted us this time, but if ever I meet you again, then you die.
      Now I have given you your life, but,&rdquo; he added, almost pleadingly, &ldquo;if you
      are really brave as white men are said to be, will you not come down and
      fight me man to man for honour&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; answered Robert, when he understood this challenge, &ldquo;for
      what chance should I have against so brave a warrior? Also this lady&mdash;my
      wife&mdash;needs my help on her journey home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maduna turned from him contemptuously to Benita.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and fear not; you will meet no Matabele on that journey.
      Have you more words for me, O Beautiful One, with a tongue of oil and a
      wit that cuts like steel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Benita. &ldquo;You have dealt well with me, and in reward I give
      you of my good luck. Bear this message to your king from the White Witch
      of Bambatse, for I am she and no other. That he leave these Makalanga, my
      servants, to dwell unharmed in their ancient home, and that he lift no
      spear against the White Men, lest that evil which the Molimo foretold to
      you, should fall upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Maduna, &ldquo;now I understand how you flew from the mountain top
      into this man&rsquo;s waggon. You are not a white woman, you are the ancient
      Witch of Bambatse herself. You have said it, and with such it is not well
      to war. Great lady of Magic, Spirit from of old, I salute you, and I thank
      you for your gifts of life and fortune. Farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he, too, stalked away at the head of his guard, so that presently,
      save for the three Zulu servants and the herd of cattle, Robert and Benita
      were left utterly alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, her part played and the victory won, Benita burst into tears and fell
      upon her lover&rsquo;s breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she remembered, and freed herself from his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a selfish wretch,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How dare I be so happy when my father
      is dead or dying? We must go at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go where?&rdquo; asked the bewildered Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the top of the mountain, of course, whence I came. Oh! please don&rsquo;t
      stop to question me, I&rsquo;ll tell you as we walk. Stay,&rdquo; and she called to
      the Zulu driver, who with an air of utter amazement was engaged in milking
      one of the gift cows, to fill two bottles with the milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had we not better shout to the Makalanga to let us in?&rdquo; suggested Robert,
      while this was being done, and Benita wrapped some cooked meat in a cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. They will think I am what I said I was&mdash;the Witch of
      Bambatse, whose appearance heralds misfortune, and fear a trap. Besides,
      we could not climb the top wall. You must follow my road, and if you can
      trust them, bring two of those men with you with lanterns. The lad can
      stop to herd the cattle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three minutes later, followed by the two Zulus, they were walking&mdash;or
      rather, running&mdash;along the banks of the Zambesi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you not come quicker?&rdquo; she asked impatiently. &ldquo;Oh, I beg your
      pardon, you are lame. Robert, what made you lame, and oh! why are you not
      dead, as they all swore you were, you, you&mdash;hero, for I know that
      part of the story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a very simple reason, Benita: because I didn&rsquo;t die. When that Kaffir
      took the watch from me I was insensible, that&rsquo;s all. The sun brought me to
      life afterwards. Then some natives turned up, good people in their way,
      although I could not understand a word they said. They made a stretcher of
      boughs and carried me for some miles to their kraal inland. It hurt
      awfully, for my thigh was broken, but I arrived at last. There a Kaffir
      doctor set my leg in his own fashion; it has left it an inch shorter than
      the other, but that&rsquo;s better than nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that place I lay for two solid months, for there was no white man
      within a hundred miles, and if there had been I could not have
      communicated with him. Afterwards I spent another month limping up towards
      Natal, until I could buy a horse. The rest is very short. Hearing of my
      reported death, I came as fast as I could to your father&rsquo;s farm, Rooi
      Krantz, where I learned from the old vrouw Sally that you had taken to
      treasure-hunting, the same treasure that I told you of on the <i>Zanzibar</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I followed your spoor, met the servants whom you had sent back, who
      told me all about you, and in due course, after many adventures, as they
      say in a book, walked into the camp of our friends, the Matabele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were going to kill me at once, when suddenly you appeared upon that
      point of rock, glittering like&mdash;like the angel of the dawn. I knew
      that it must be you, for I had found out about your attempted escape, and
      how you were hunted back to this place. But the Matabele all thought that
      it was the Spirit of Bambatse, who has a great reputation in these parts.
      Well, that took off their attention, and afterwards, as I told you, it
      occurred to them that I might be an engineer. You know the rest, don&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Benita softly. &ldquo;I know the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they plunged into the reeds and were obliged to stop talking, since
      they must walk in single file. Presently Benita looked up and saw that she
      was under the thorn which grew in the cleft of the rock. Also, with some
      trouble she found the bunch of reeds that she had bent down, to mark the
      inconspicuous hole through which she had crept, and by it her lantern. It
      seemed weeks since she had left it there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;light your candles, and if you see a crocodile, please
      shoot.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>

    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE TRUE GOLD
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go first,&rdquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Benita. &ldquo;I know the way; but please do watch for that
      horrible crocodile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she knelt down and crept into the hole, while after her came Robert,
      and after him the two Zulus, who protested that they were not ant-bears to
      burrow under ground. Lifting the lantern she searched the cave, and as she
      could see no signs of the crocodile, walked on boldly to where the stair
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quick,&rdquo; she whispered to Robert, for in that place it seemed natural
      to speak low. &ldquo;My father is above and near his death. I am dreadfully
      afraid lest we should be too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they toiled up the endless steps, a very strange procession, for the
      two Zulus, bold men enough outside, were shaking with fright, till at
      length Benita clambered out of the trap door on to the floor of the
      treasure chamber, and turned to help Robert, whose lameness made him
      somewhat slow and awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all that?&rdquo; he asked, pointing to the hide sacks, while they waited
      for the two scared Kaffirs to join them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she answered indifferently, &ldquo;gold, I believe. Look, there is some of
      it on the floor, over Benita da Ferreira&rsquo;s footsteps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gold! Why, it must be worth&mdash;&mdash;! And who on earth is Benita da
      Ferreira?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you afterwards. She has been dead two or three hundred years;
      it was her gold, or her people&rsquo;s, and those are her footprints in the
      dust. How stupid you are not to understand! Never mind the hateful stuff;
      come on quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they passed the door which she had opened that morning, and clambered
      up the remaining stairway. So full was Benita of terrors that she could
      never remember how she climbed them. Suppose that the foot of the crucifix
      had swung to; suppose that her father were dead; suppose that Jacob Meyer
      had broken into the cave? Well for herself she was no longer afraid of
      Jacob Meyer. Oh, they were there! The heavy door <i>had</i> begun to
      close, but mercifully her bit of rock kept it ajar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father! Father!&rdquo; she cried, running towards the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer came. She threw aside the flap, held down the lantern and
      looked. There he lay, white and still. She was too late!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead, he is dead!&rdquo; she wailed. Robert knelt down at her side, and
      examined the old man, while she waited in an agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to be,&rdquo; he said slowly; &ldquo;but, Benita, I don&rsquo;t think he is. I can
      feel his heart stir. No, don&rsquo;t stop to talk. Pour out some of that
      squareface, and here, mix it with this milk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed, and while he held up her father&rsquo;s head, with a trembling hand
      emptied a little of the drink into his mouth. At first it ran out again,
      then almost automatically he swallowed some, and they knew that he was
      alive, and thanked Heaven. Ten minutes later Mr. Clifford was sitting up
      staring at them with dull and wondering eyes, while outside the two Zulus,
      whose nerves had now utterly broken down, were contemplating the pile of
      skeletons in the corner and the white towering crucifix, and loudly
      lamenting that they should have been brought to perish in this place of
      bones and ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Jacob Meyer who makes that noise?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clifford faintly.
      &ldquo;And, Benita, where have you been so long, and&mdash;who is this gentleman
      with you? I seem to remember his face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the white man who was in the waggon, father, an old friend come to
      life again. Robert, can&rsquo;t you stop the howling of those Kaffirs? Though I
      am sure I don&rsquo;t wonder that they howl; I should have liked to do so for
      days. Oh! father, father, don&rsquo;t you understand me? We are saved, yes,
      snatched out of hell and the jaws of death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Jacob Meyer dead, then?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where he is or what has happened to him, and I don&rsquo;t care,
      but perhaps we had better find out. Robert, there is a madman outside.
      Make the Kaffirs pull down that wall, would you? and catch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What wall? What madman?&rdquo; he asked, staring at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course you don&rsquo;t know that, either. You know nothing. I&rsquo;ll show
      you, and you must be prepared, for probably he will shoot at us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all sounds a little risky, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Robert doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but we must take the risk. We cannot carry my father down that
      place, and unless we can get him into light and air soon, he will
      certainly die. The man outside is Jacob Meyer, his partner&mdash;you
      remember him. All these weeks of hardship and treasure-hunting have sent
      him off his head, and he wanted to mesmerize me and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what? Make love to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, then went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So when he could not get his way about the mesmerism and so forth, he
      threatened to murder my father, and that is why we had to hide in this
      cave and build ourselves up, till at last I found the way out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amiable gentleman, Mr. Jacob Meyer, now as always,&rdquo; said Robert flushing.
      &ldquo;To think that you should have been in the power of a scoundrel like that!
      Well, I hope to come square with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt him, dear, unless you are obliged. Remember he is not
      responsible. He thought he saw a ghost here the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless he behaves himself he is likely to see a good many soon,&rdquo; muttered
      Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they went down the cave, and as silently as possible began to work at
      the wall, destroying in a few minutes what had been built up with so much
      labour. When it was nearly down the Zulus were told that there was an
      enemy outside, and that they must help to catch him if necessary, but were
      not to harm him. They assented gladly enough; indeed, to get out of that
      cave they would have faced half a dozen enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there was a hole right through the wall, and Robert bade Benita stand
      to one side. Then as soon as his eyes became accustomed to the little
      light that penetrated there, he drew his revolver and beckoned the Kaffirs
      to follow. Down the passage they crept, slowly, lest they should be
      blinded when they came to the glare of the sunshine, while Benita waited
      with a beating heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little time went by, she never knew how long, till suddenly a rifle shot
      rang through the stillness. Benita was able to bear no more. She rushed
      down the winding passage, and presently, just beyond its mouth, in a
      blurred and indistinct fashion saw that the two white men were rolling
      together on the ground, while the Kaffirs sprang round watching for an
      opportunity to seize one of them. At that moment they succeeded, and
      Robert rose, dusting his hands and knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amiable gentleman, Mr. Jacob Meyer,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I could have killed
      him as his back was towards me, but didn&rsquo;t because you asked me not. Then
      I stumbled with my lame leg, and he whipped round and let drive with his
      rifle. Look,&rdquo; and he showed her where the bullet had cut his ear. &ldquo;Luckily
      I got hold of him before he could loose off another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benita could find no words, her heart was too full of thankfulness. Only
      she seized Robert&rsquo;s hand and kissed it. Then she looked at Jacob.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was lying upon the broad of his back, the two big Zulus holding his
      arms and legs; his lips were cracked, blue and swollen; his face was
      almost black, but his eyes still shone bright with insanity and hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you,&rdquo; he screamed hoarsely to Robert. &ldquo;You are another ghost, the
      ghost of that man who was drowned. Otherwise my bullet would have killed
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Meyer,&rdquo; Seymour answered, &ldquo;I am a ghost. Now, you boys, here&rsquo;s a
      bit of rope. Tie his hands behind his back and search him. There is a
      pistol in that pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They obeyed, and presently Meyer was disarmed and bound fast to a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water,&rdquo; he moaned. &ldquo;For days I have had nothing but the dew I could lick
      off the leaves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pitying his plight, Benita ran into the cave and returned presently with a
      tin of water. One of the Kaffirs held it to his lips, and he drank
      greedily. Then, leaving one Zulu to watch him, Robert, Benita, and the
      other Zulu went back, and as gently as they could carried out Mr. Clifford
      on his mattress, placing him in the shade of a rock, where he lay blessing
      them feebly, because they had brought him into the light again. At the
      sight of the old man Meyer&rsquo;s rage blazed up afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he screamed, &ldquo;if only I had killed you long ago, she would be mine
      now, not that fellow&rsquo;s. It was you who stood between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, my friend,&rdquo; broke in Robert. &ldquo;I forgive you everything else,
      but, mad or sane, be good enough to keep Miss Clifford&rsquo;s name off your
      lips, or I will hand you over to those Kaffirs to be dealt with as you
      deserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Jacob understood, and was silent. They gave him more water and food
      to eat, some of the meat that they had brought with them, which he
      devoured ravenously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sensible now?&rdquo; asked Robert when he had done. &ldquo;Then listen to me;
      I have some good news for you. That treasure you have been hunting for has
      been found. We are going to give you half of it, one of the waggons and
      some oxen, and clear you out of this place. Then if I set eyes on you
      again before we get to a civilized country, I shoot you like a dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; said Meyer sullenly. &ldquo;You want to turn me out into the
      wilderness to be murdered by the Makalanga or the Matabele.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;Untie him, boys, and bring him along. I will
      show him whether I lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they taking me to?&rdquo; asked Meyer. &ldquo;Not into the cave? I won&rsquo;t go
      into the cave; it is haunted. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for the ghost there I
      would have broken down their wall long ago, and killed that old snake
      before her eyes. Whenever I went near that wall I saw it watching me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First time I ever heard of a ghost being useful,&rdquo; remarked Robert. &ldquo;Bring
      him along. No, Benita, he shall see whether I am a liar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the lights were lit, and the two stalwart Zulus hauled Jacob forward,
      Robert and Benita following. At first he struggled violently, then, on
      finding that he could not escape, went on, his teeth chattering with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is cruel,&rdquo; remonstrated Benita.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little cruelty will not do him any harm,&rdquo; Robert answered. &ldquo;He has
      plenty to spare for other people. Besides, he is going to get what he has
      been looking for so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They led Jacob to the foot of the crucifix, where a paroxysm seemed to
      seize him, then pushed him through the swinging doorway beneath, and down
      the steep stairs, till once more they all stood in the treasure-chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said Robert, and, drawing his hunting-knife, he slashed one of the
      hide bags, whereon instantly there flowed out a stream of beads and
      nuggets. &ldquo;Now, my friend, am I a liar?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this wondrous sight Jacob&rsquo;s terror seemed to depart from him, and he
      grew cunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful, beautiful!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;more than I thought&mdash;sacks and
      sacks of gold. I shall be a king indeed. No, no, it is all a dream&mdash;like
      the rest. I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s there. Loose my arms and let me feel it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Untie him,&rdquo; said Robert, at the same time drawing his pistol and covering
      the man; &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t do us any hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Kaffirs obeyed, and Jacob, springing at the slashed bag, plunged his
      thin hands into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No lie,&rdquo; he screamed, &ldquo;no lie,&rdquo; as he dragged the stuff out and smelt at
      it. &ldquo;Gold, gold, gold! Hundreds of thousands of pounds&rsquo; worth of gold!
      Let&rsquo;s make a bargain, Englishman, and I won&rsquo;t kill you as I meant to do.
      You take the girl and give me all the gold,&rdquo; and in his ecstasy he began
      to pour the glittering ingots over his head and body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A new version of the tale of Danaë,&rdquo; began Robert in a sarcastic voice,
      then suddenly paused, for a change had come over Jacob&rsquo;s face, a terrible
      change.
    </p>
    <p>
      It turned ashen beneath the tan, his eyes grew large and round, he put up
      his hands as though to thrust something from him, his whole frame
      shivered, and his hair seemed to erect itself. Slowly he retreated
      backwards, and would have fallen down the unclosed trap-hole had not one
      of the Kaffirs pushed him away. Back he went, still back, till he struck
      the further wall and stood there, perhaps for half a minute. He lifted his
      hand and pointed first to those ancient footprints, some of which still
      remained in the dust of the floor, and next, as they thought, at Benita.
      His lips moved fast, he seemed to be pleading, remonstrating, yet&mdash;and
      this was the ghastliest part of it&mdash;from them there came no sound.
      Lastly, his eyes rolled up until only the whites of them were visible, his
      face became wet as though water had been poured over it, and, still
      without a sound, he fell forward and moved no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      So terrible was the scene that with a howl of fear the two Kaffirs turned
      and fled up the stairway. Robert sprang to the Jew, dragged him over on to
      his back, put his hand upon his breast and lifted his eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Stone dead. Privation, brain excitement, heart failure&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; answered Benita faintly; &ldquo;but really I think that I begin to
      believe in ghosts also. Look, I never noticed them before, and I didn&rsquo;t
      walk there, but those footsteps seem to lead right up to him.&rdquo; Then she
      turned too and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another week had gone by. The waggons were laden with a burden more
      precious perhaps than waggons have often borne before. In one of them, on
      a veritable bed of gold, slept Mr. Clifford, still very weak and ill, but
      somewhat better than he had been, and with a good prospect of recovery, at
      any rate for a while. They were to trek a little after dawn, and already
      Robert and Benita were up and waiting. She touched his arm and said to
      him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me. I have a fancy to see that place once more, for the last
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they climbed the hill and the steep steps in the topmost wall that
      Meyer had blocked&mdash;re-opened now&mdash;and reaching the mouth of the
      cave, lit the lamps which they had brought with them, and entered. There
      were the fragments of the barricade that Benita had built with desperate
      hands, there was the altar of sacrifice standing cold and grey as it had
      stood for perhaps three thousand years. There was the tomb of the old monk
      who had a companion now, for in it Jacob Meyer lay with him, his bones
      covered by the <i>débris</i> that he himself had dug out in his mad search
      for wealth; and there the white Christ hung awful on His cross. Only the
      skeletons of the Portuguese were gone, for with the help of his Kaffirs
      Robert had moved them every one into the empty treasure-chamber, closing
      the trap beneath, and building up the door above, so that there they might
      lie in peace at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this melancholy place they tarried but a little while, then, turning
      their backs upon it for ever, went out and climbed the granite cone to
      watch the sun rise over the broad Zambesi. Up it came in glory, that same
      sun which had shone upon the despairing Benita da Ferreira, and upon the
      English Benita when she had stood there in utter hopelessness, and seen
      the white man captured by the Matabele.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, different was their state indeed, and there in that high place,
      whence perhaps many a wretched creature had been cast to death, whence
      certainly the Portuguese maiden had sought her death, these two happy
      beings were not ashamed to give thanks to Heaven for the joy which it had
      vouchsafed to them, and for their hopes of life full and long to be
      travelled hand in hand. Behind them was the terror of the cave, beneath
      them were the mists of the valley, but above them the light shone and
      rolled and sparkled, and above them stretched the eternal sky!
    </p>
    <p>
      They descended the pillar, and near the foot of it saw an old man sitting.
      It was Mambo, the Molimo of the Makalanga: even when they were still far
      away from him they knew his snow-white head and thin, ascetic face. As
      they drew near Benita perceived that his eyes were closed, and whispered
      to Robert that he was asleep. Yet he had heard them coming, and even
      guessed her thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maiden,&rdquo; he said in his gentle voice, &ldquo;maiden who soon shall be a wife, I
      do not sleep, although I dream of you as I have dreamt before. What did I
      say to you that day when first we met? That for you I had good tidings;
      that though death was all about you, you need not fear; that in this place
      you who had known great sorrow should find happiness and rest. Yet,
      maiden, you would not believe the words of the Munwali, spoken by his
      prophet&rsquo;s lips, as he at your side, who shall be your husband, would not
      believe me in years past when I told him that we should meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I thought your rest was that which we find only
      in the grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not believe,&rdquo; he went on without heeding her, &ldquo;and therefore
      you tried to fly, and therefore your heart was torn with terror and with
      agony, when it should have waited for the end in confidence and peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, my trial was very sore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maiden, I know it, and because it was so sore that patient Spirit of
      Bambatse bore with you, and through it all guided your feet aright. Yes,
      with you has that Spirit gone, by day, by night, in the morning and in the
      evening. Who was it that smote the man who lies dead yonder with horror
      and with madness when he would have bent your will to his and made you a
      wife to him? Who was it that told you the secret of the treasure-pit, and
      what footsteps went before you down its stair? Who was it that led you
      past the sentries of the Amandabele and gave you wit and power to snatch
      your lord&rsquo;s life from Maduna&rsquo;s bloody hand? Yes, with you it has gone and
      with you it will go. No more shall the White Witch stand upon the pillar
      point at the rising of the sun, or in the shining of the moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I have never understood you, and I do not understand you now,&rdquo;
       said Benita. &ldquo;What has this spirit to do with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled a little, then answered slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I may not tell you; that you shall learn one day, but never here.
      When you also have entered into silence, then you shall learn. But I say
      to you that this shall not be till your hair is as white as mine, and your
      years are as many. Ah! you thought that I had deserted you, when fearing
      for your father&rsquo;s life you wept and prayed in the darkness of the cave.
      Yet it was not so, for I did but suffer the doom which I had read to
      fulfil itself as it must do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet and, resting on his staff, laid one withered hand upon
      the head of Benita.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maiden,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we meet no more beneath the sun. Yet because you have
      brought deliverance to my people, because you are sweet and pure and true,
      take with you the blessing of Munwali, spoken by the mouth of his servant
      Mambo, the old Molimo of Bambatse. Though from time to time you must know
      tears and walk in the shade of sorrows, long and happy shall be your days
      with him whom you have chosen. Children shall spring up about you, and
      children&rsquo;s children, and with them also shall the blessing go. The gold
      you white folk love is yours, and it shall multiply and give food to the
      hungry and raiment to those that are a-cold. Yet in your own heart lies a
      richer store that cannot melt away, the countless treasure of mercy and of
      love. When you sleep and when you wake Love shall take you by the hand,
      till at length he leads you through life&rsquo;s dark cave to that eternal house
      of purest gold which soon or late those that seek it shall inherit,&rdquo; and
      with his staff he pointed to the glowing morning sky wherein one by one
      little rosy clouds floated upwards and were lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Robert and to Benita&rsquo;s misty eyes they looked like bright-winged angels
      throwing wide the black doors of night, and heralding that conquering
      glory at whose advent despair and darkness flee away.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
